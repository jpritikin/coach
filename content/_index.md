I offer a serene and confidential environment to talk about matters of the heart.
My goal is to help you reprocess your psychological pain and suffering in a way that releases any detrimental limits for love, contentment, and positive self-concept (🤪 and 😬 → 😇).
I use **Internal Family Systems**
(IFS). IFS is an [evidence-based](https://www.foundationifs.org/news-articles/79-ifs-an-evidence-based-practice) and [trauma-informed](https://www.verywellmind.com/trauma-informed-therapy-definition-and-techniques-5209445) model.

## Areas of Expertise

- Individual emotional & relationship issues (couple or dyad) ❤️
  - [IFS is similar to psychotherapy, addressing many of the same conditions.]({{< relref "dsm" >}})
  - I provide *counseling* under [ORS 675.825(4)(a)](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_675.825), which allows alternative counselors to practice legally in Oregon without a license.
  - Since I am **not** licensed in Oregon, I cannot describe myself as a *psychotherapist*. [ORS 675.020](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_675.020)
- Psychedelic prep & integration 🍄/🐸
  - Prepare to take your first psychedelic journey safely
  - Understand and integrate your psychedelic journey(s)
  - I do **not** prescribe, procure, or administer substances.
- Expecting your first child? 🚼
  - Ready for a new full-time job without sleep? Learn the mental health tools you need **before** the proverbial shit hits the fan. 💩
  - If you put more skill and effort into the first three years, you and your child will reap a lifetime of benefits.
- Lifestyle, nutrition, & physical health 🥗
  - I have studied nutrition for many years and am trained to evaluate statistical evidence.
  - I am **not** a licensed dietician.[^capture-of-nutrition]
  - I am **not** a medical doctor.

## Notes

[^capture-of-nutrition]: Is it probably a good thing that I am not a licensed dietician given [The corporate capture of the nutrition profession in the USA: the case of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-in-the-usa-the-case-of-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/9FCF66087DFD5661DF1AF2AD54DA0DF9).
