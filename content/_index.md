My goal is to empower you to have more access to calm, confidence,
courage, clarity, and connection. I use **Internal Family Systems**
(IFS). IFS is an [evidence-based](https://www.foundationifs.org/news-articles/79-ifs-an-evidence-based-practice) mode of counseling that has been
proven to heal many forms of psychological suffering.

IFS is a full range modality. Most psychotherapy aims to help people
get from ‘bad’ to ‘so-so,’ or from ‘so-so’ to ‘good’. IFS can also
help people get from ‘good’ to ‘great’. IFS is a [trauma-informed](https://www.verywellmind.com/trauma-informed-therapy-definition-and-techniques-5209445) model.

## What does counseling look like?

As a default, I recommend 75-minute sessions on a weekly basis. However,
other schedules can be accommodated.
The duration of therapy can vary depending on your needs and motivation.
During the no-fee consultation, we’ll decide together what is the best fit.

## Notes

[^capture-of-nutrition]: Is it probably a good thing that I am not a licensed dietician given [The corporate capture of the nutrition profession in the USA: the case of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-in-the-usa-the-case-of-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/9FCF66087DFD5661DF1AF2AD54DA0DF9).

[^audio-only]: In the classical approach to psychotherapy, the client lies on a couch and does not look the therapist directly in the eye while speaking.
