## Hi, I'm Joshua Pritikin.

My goal is to empower you with more access to calm, confidence,
courage, clarity, and connection. I use **Internal Family Systems**
(IFS). IFS is an evidence-based mode of psychotherapy that has been
proven to heal many forms of psychological suffering.

IFS is a full range therapy. Most psychotherapy aims to help people
get from ‘bad’ to ‘so-so,’ or from ‘so-so’ to ‘good’. IFS can also
help people get from ‘good’ to ‘great’.
