My goal is to empower you to have more access to calm, confidence,
courage, clarity, and connection. I use **Internal Family Systems**
(IFS). IFS is an [evidence-based](https://www.foundationifs.org/news-articles/79-ifs-an-evidence-based-practice) mode of counseling that has been
proven to heal many forms of psychological suffering.

IFS is a full range modality. Most psychotherapy aims to help people
get from ‘bad’ to ‘so-so,’ or from ‘so-so’ to ‘good’. IFS can also
help people get from ‘good’ to ‘great’.
