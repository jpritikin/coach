I offer a serene and confidential environment to talk about matters of the heart. 💖

My goal is to help you reprocess your psychological pain and suffering in a way that releases any detrimental limits for love, contentment, and positive self-concept (🤪 and 😬 → 😇).

I use **Internal Family Systems** (IFS). IFS is an [evidence-based](https://www.foundationifs.org/research/empirical-evidence) and [trauma-informed](https://www.verywellmind.com/trauma-informed-therapy-definition-and-techniques-5209445) model. ![IFS](/images/ifs-logo.webp)

## Areas of Expertise

## Notes

[^capture-of-nutrition]: Is it probably a good thing that I am not a licensed dietician given [The corporate capture of the nutrition profession in the USA: the case of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-in-the-usa-the-case-of-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/9FCF66087DFD5661DF1AF2AD54DA0DF9).
