Response:

Dear Congressmen Bergman and Correa,

I am writing to share my expertise on the therapeutic potential of psychedelic and entactogenic drugs, and to advocate for evidence-based policies that promote public health and safety.

As a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology and a practicing psychological counselor, I have a deep understanding of the complexities of mental health and the potential benefits and risks of these substances. My experience informs my conviction that these drugs should be legalized and regulated.

Drugs are often blamed as a scapegoat to distract from real problems such as poverty, mental health issues, lack of education, and lack of affordable housing. Criminalizing drug use perpetuates harm, rather than reducing it. Prohibition drives users to unregulated sources, increasing the risk of contamination, overdose, and long-term health problems. It also leads to arrests, convictions, and incarceration, causing significant social and economic burdens. The stress and fear associated with criminalization exacerbate mental health issues and deter individuals from seeking help. The main harms associated with drugs are caused not by the drugs themselves.

We should prioritize harm reduction strategies, such as safe supply initiatives and evidence-based treatment programs. Regulation, rather than prohibition, can ensure quality control, labeling, and age restrictions, as seen in some states' approaches to hemp-based cannabinoids.

The accidental legalization of hemp-based cannabinoids via the 2018 Farm Bill demonstrates the potential for broader legalization. Hemp-based delta-8 THC is approximately as powerful as traditional THC. The sky didn't fall. Regulations can address quality control, labeling, age restrictions, advertising, licensing, and research. This approach prioritizes public safety while encouraging innovation.

The Oregon Psilocybin Service Program is a positive step, but its high cost (over $1000 per session) limits accessibility. To truly address mental health needs, legalization and regulation is the only way to lower costs sufficiently. The FDA's recent decision to deny approval of MDMA highlights the absurdity of the current approach to drug regulation. To be morally consistent, we should criminalize horse riding (Nutt, 2009).

I would appreciate the opportunity to provide further input and feedback on this critical issue. Thank you for your consideration.
