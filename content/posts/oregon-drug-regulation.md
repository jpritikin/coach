Dear Oregon Legislators,

I am writing to urge you to consider the full legalization of drugs in Oregon—not merely decriminalization, but a comprehensive shift away from criminal enforcement and toward a public health approach. The current strategy of criminalizing drug use continues to waste valuable police resources, fails to address the root causes of addiction, and diverts funding from effective solutions.

Despite years of debate and reform, Oregon continues to allocate significant law enforcement resources to the policing of drug possession and use[1]. Even after the partial decriminalization under Measure 110, recent legislative changes have returned us to a system where police are once again tasked with arresting individuals for minor drug offenses[3]. This approach has proven ineffective at reducing drug use or overdoses, and it diverts officers from addressing violent crime and other public safety priorities.

Portugal’s experience offers a compelling alternative. After fully decriminalizing drug use in 2001 and treating addiction as a public health issue, Portugal saw a 75% reduction in drug-related deaths over two decades[3]. Their police were freed from the burdens of enforcing drug possession laws, allowing them to focus on serious criminal activity. Meanwhile, resources were redirected to prevention, treatment, and harm reduction—proven strategies that save lives and improve community well-being.

Oregon faces a severe shortfall in addiction services. The state spends about $500 million annually on substance use disorder services, yet the actual need is estimated at $6.85 billion per year[2]. There are not enough treatment beds, detox centers, or qualified professionals to meet demand. Rather than investing in more policing, these funds should be redirected to close the treatment gap and expand prevention efforts.

Law enforcement alone cannot solve addiction. As experts have testified, “so long as it’s easier to get fentanyl than it is to get the treatment for opioid use disorder, we will continue to see a rise in overdose deaths”. Criminalization only drives people away from help and into the shadows, making overdoses and public health crises more likely.

Full legalization would allow Oregon to:

- End the wasteful use of police resources on drug enforcement.
- Redirect funding to evidence-based treatment, prevention, and harm reduction.
- Reduce the stigma that prevents people from seeking help.
- Follow the example of countries like Portugal, which have seen dramatic improvements in public health and safety.

I urge you to stop repeating the mistakes of the past. Legalization, paired with robust public health investment, is the only way to truly address Oregon’s addiction crisis and use our resources wisely.
