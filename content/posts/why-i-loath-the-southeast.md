I spent about a decade in the Southeast. I lived in [Charlottesville, VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) from 2011 to 2017 and in Richmond, VA from 2017 to 2021. Although I identify as one of the most privileged demographics, a white heterosexual man, I suffered from the racism of the Southeast. There is a subtle vibe of cruelty that taints everything from wealthy suburbs to the decaying downtown. I am so glad to leave that place.
