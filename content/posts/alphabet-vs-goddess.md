Many assume that the invention of a phonetic alphabet only brought
benefits. In a somewhat speculative reassessment of history, Shlain
makes the case that the phonetic alphabet advanced lawyer-style
thinking that greatly facilitated the justification of violence.
The book is unlikely to be 100% true, but also unlikely to be 100% false.
