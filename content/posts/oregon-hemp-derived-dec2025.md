This https://oregonstatecannabis.org/thc/delta-8 is a travesty.

We don't make lettuce illegal because it might be contaminated
with salmonella. We regulate it. We should be doing the same
for Federally legal hemp-derived cannabinoids. The state can
mandate independent lab testing for contaminants.
