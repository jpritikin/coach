Subject: Drug policy reform

I am writing as your constituent to urge you to consider evidence-based drug policy reform, specifically the restoration of blanket decriminalization and exploration of regulated drug dispensaries. I base this request on the recently published Portland State University study ["Examining the Multifaceted Impacts of Drug Decriminalization on Public Safety, Law Enforcement, and Prosecutorial Discretion" (2024)](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/ccj_fac/128/), which provides crucial insights into Oregon's drug policy experiences.

**The Evidence Supporting Decriminalization**

The PSU study's comprehensive 16-year analysis reveals that Oregon's brief decriminalization period (2021-2024) did not cause the public safety crisis often attributed to it. Key findings include:

- **No sustained impact on violent crime**: Violent crime rates remained stable throughout decriminalization
- **Minimal property crime effects**: While property crimes briefly increased post-M110, they returned to pre-pandemic levels and showed no lasting association with decriminalization
- **Overdose deaths driven by fentanyl, not policy**: The tragic rise in overdoses was primarily attributable to fentanyl saturation in the drug market and COVID-19 impacts, not decriminalization itself

**Current Prohibition Wastes Critical Resources**

The report documents enormous resource expenditure under criminalization:

- Pre-decriminalization: Over 23,000 annual PCS arrests consuming thousands of officer hours
- Court system burden: Hundreds of thousands of possession cases clogging prosecutors and courts
- Minimal treatment connection: Even at peak enforcement, only 7% of those needing treatment were reached through arrests

Law enforcement officers themselves noted that defelonization (reducing possession from felony to misdemeanor in 2017) was actually beneficial, reducing dangerous high-speed chases while maintaining their enforcement tools.

**A Path Forward: Regulated Dispensaries**

While decriminalization reduces harm, it doesn't address the fundamental problem: the illegal drug market that fuels violence, contamination, and smuggling. Consider how alcohol prohibition created identical problems—violence, contamination, resource waste—that ended only with legal regulation.

State-run dispensaries for currently illegal substances would:

1. **Eliminate smuggling incentives**: Remove the profit motive driving cartels and trafficking
2. **Ensure product safety**: Provide known, uncontaminated substances reducing overdose risks
3. **Generate revenue**: Fund treatment and harm reduction services
4. **Free law enforcement**: Allow police to focus on actual public safety threats
5. **Reduce court burden**: Eliminate thousands of possession cases annually

**Implementation Considerations**

The PSU study emphasizes the importance of stakeholder buy-in and careful implementation. Any regulated system should:

- Include law enforcement, public health, and community representatives in planning
- Maintain robust treatment and harm reduction services (as M110's BHRN networks demonstrated success)
- Implement graduated access based on age and health assessments
- Direct revenues toward treatment, education, and community support

**Conclusion**

The evidence is clear: criminalization wastes resources while failing to reduce drug use or improve public safety. Decriminalization is a necessary first step, but regulated access addresses the root cause—the dangerous illegal market itself.

I urge you to champion evidence-based policy that prioritizes public health, reduces incarceration, eliminates cartel profits, and allows our law enforcement to focus on genuine threats to community safety.

Thank you for your consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this further and provide additional research supporting these positions.
