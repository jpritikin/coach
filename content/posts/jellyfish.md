A pencil sketch of jellyfish and a fish. The jellyfish are in the foreground, and are much larger than the fish. The jellyfish have a bell-shaped body with long, trailing tentacles. The fish is swimming near the jellyfish's tentacles, but it is not clear what species of fish it is.

The sketch is very detailed, and the artist has captured the delicate nature of the jellyfish's body and tentacles. The fish is also well-drawn, and it looks like it is swimming gracefully through the water.
