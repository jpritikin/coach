A pencil sketch of a person holding a seashell. The person is cradling the seashell in their hands. The seashell is large and spiral-shaped, and it looks like it has been worn smooth by the sea. The sketch is very detailed, and the artist has used a variety of shading techniques to create a sense of depth and dimension.

Photo taken Jun 2018.
