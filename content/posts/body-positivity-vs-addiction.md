## What is the debate? 🥊

According to epidemiological studies,[^fontana2014] the threshold for BMI is 20–21 kg m<sup>-2</sup>.

💥 yet 💥
{.center}

> We envision a world where BMI does not exist, and is not replaced with another size-based, anti-fat measure of health.[^asdah]

What is the impulse behind movements like Health At Every Size[^asdah] and Intuitive Eating[^tribole2012]?

## Shape of the motivating story 🎭

> Suppose I have depression 😟.
> The only thing that fills that void in my heart is ice cream 🍨.
> If I don't eat ice cream, I will kill myself 🪓.
> On the other hand, if I do eat ice cream, I might gain weight 🎈.
> Which option would you rather I pick? 🗳️

Let's unpack this 🪆.

### Eat ice cream

    e-->>p: A belly full of ice cream helps numb the pain.
    Note over p: Feeling a bit better. ❤️‍🩹

### Don't eat ice cream

    a->>e: We got a problem. Fix it.
    Note over e: I've been shamed for eating ice<br/>cream. Sorry, I feel paralyzed 🤐.
    p->>a: Hey, I'm still in pain! It's getting intolerable! Do something! 🔥
    a->>s: We got a problem. Fix it.
    Note over s: I don't really want to, 🤮<br/>but okay. I got this. 🪓
    Note over a: I'm dead, but at least<br/>I'm not in pain.

This is not a good outcome. Alice committed suicide ⚰️.
Movements like Health At Every Size[^asdah] and Intuitive Eating[^tribole2012] want to avoid this outcome at any cost.
Let's try this again with Alice's friend Bob who subscribes to [body positivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_positivity).

    a->>b: Hey Bob, I've got a problem.<br/>I'm in a lot of pain.
    Note over b: Crap! 🙀 Alice is<br/>in a tight spot!
    b->>e: I declare: There is no shame in eating ice cream.
    b->>a: Can you appreciate<br/>your ice cream<br/>eating part?
    a->>e: *Appreciation* 💞
    Note over e: Oh, okay. I'll eat ice cream. 🍨
    e-->>p: A belly full of ice cream helps numb the pain.
    Note over p: Feeling a bit better. ❤️‍🩹

This is better than the *Don't eat ice cream* scenario.
At least Alice stays alive.
However, Alice's Pain is still lingering unresolved and her growing BMI is putting her at increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer ☣️.[^fontana2014]

> It’s really hard to stay in your truth when you really are being abnormalized and you feel socially ousted because we are tribal by nature and need to survive by staying in our tribes, and so there’s so much against us. Further worsening the situation is the normalization of obesity. I am shamed, as a registered dietitian, for talking about healthy weight and weight loss! There are movements trying to stop the conversation, claiming there are no negative health sequelae associated with excess weight, when clearly that is well-substantiated.[^williams2023]

## Addiction through an IFS lens 🔍

[IFS]({{< relref "ifs" >}}) recognizes the value of Alice's coping parts, but also aims to heal Alice's pain.[^sykes2023]
By addressing the root cause, Alice is no longer compelled to eat ice cream and gains more control over her BMI.
To get your head around this approach, it can help to watch a recorded session 🖥️.
Dick presented a great demo on 2022 Sep 21, where he worked with an addicted system, as part of the [IFS Continuity Program](https://learn.ifs-institute.com/continuity-program-waitlist/).

### Intervening with IFS

{{< hint danger >}}
This example is offered to suggest a therapeutic direction, not as an instruction manual.
Alice is in a vulnerable place.
A safe IFS intervention demands enlistment of a trained professional 🦺.
Alice should approach a Certified IFS Practitioner 💐 to discuss her situation.

    e->>b: I have been shamed for eating ice cream.
    b->>e: I declare: There is no shame in eating ice cream.<br/>By eating ice cream, aren't you helping Alice cope with the pain?
    Note over e: Good point.
    b->>e: If Alice and I could help the part that is in<br/>pain, would you be interested in that?
    e->>b: Sure, that would be great. If that part felt<br/>better than I wouldn't need to eat so much ice cream.
    b->>a: Can you thank the ice cream eating<br/>part for giving us permission to<br/>help the part holding the pain?
    a->>e: *Graditude* 💞
    Note over e: You're welcome.
    b->>a: Do you have any other<br/>parts watching the<br/>part holding the pain?
    a->>b: Yeah, I have a suicidal part.
    Note over b: Okay, I got this.
    b->>a: Can you appreciate your<br/>suicidal part?
    a->>b: Huh?
    b->>a: Yeah, if your ice cream eating part<br/>gets paralyzed then you still<br/>have a way to not be in pain.
    s->>b: I really don't want to kill Alice.
    b->>s: Yeah, I get that.<br/>If Alice and I could help the part holding Alice's pain, would you be interested in that?

    p->>b: Yeah, I'm here.
    b->>p: What happened to you? How did you get all this pain?
    Note over p: *Describes a recent trauma.*
    b->>p: That's horrible. I'm sorry you had to experience that.<br/>What is your earliest memory of feeling that way?
    Note over p: *Describes the earliest trauma.*
    b->>a: How do you feel toward<br/>the part holding the pain<br/>when you hear that?
    a->>b: I feel a lot of compassion.
    b->>a: Let the part feel that.
    a->>p: *Compassion* 💞
    Note over p: Somebody cares<br/>about me. ❤️‍🩹
    Note over b: *Bob continues to guide ⛽<br/>Alice to help her young part<br/>that is holding the pain.*
    b->>p: Are you feeling the compassion from Alice? What is it like to feel that?
