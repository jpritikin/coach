## LGBTQ+

LGBTQ+ is an acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and
Queer/Questioning. But collecting these ideas together into a single
category blurs an important distinction. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual
describe who you are attracted to. These dispositions have some
genetic basis. Transgender identity is different—it describes a
relationship with your own body, and its recent surge among
adolescents points to social contagion rather than genetics.

## The body is not the Self

When I look at a friend, I see someone I love—a beautiful,
intelligent person. I barely notice their body. The body is a
meat-suit. It is not who you are.

Most people confuse the two: A man who derives his sense of identity
from his physique. A woman who feels diminished by aging. An athlete
whose sense of self shatters along with a career-ending injury. These
are all cases of mistaking the body for the Self.

In Internal Family Systems, the Self is characterized by timeless
qualities—curiosity, compassion, calm, clarity. These qualities feel
the same whether you are age seven or thirty-five. The Self has
no gender, no age, no body. It is who you are when no
part is speaking for you.

## Scope

This essay examines the internal psychology of gender dysphoria—the
relationship between parts and Self. It does not address external
realities: hormones, surgery, social transition, legal recognition.
These matter. In particular, medical interventions can be irreversible
or difficult to reverse. Someone who resolves their dysphoria through
internal work still has to live with whatever physical changes they
have already made. That is a real and serious consideration, but it is
outside the scope of this analysis.

## Is transgenderism genetic?

Almost certainly not. Unlike sexual orientation, which has some
genetic basis,[^bragazzi2023] transgender identity faces a
straightforward evolutionary problem: it reduces reproductive fitness.
A trait that discourages reproduction with the body you have would be
selected against.

Some researchers have proposed a biological mechanism: discordance
between gonadal development and brain sexual differentiation during
fetal development. Evidence suggests that brain anatomy and neuronal
signaling can be more closely aligned with a person's perceived
gender identity than with their gonadal sex.[^boucher2020] But the
researchers themselves acknowledge that not enough evidence associates
these differences with gender dysphoria, and the mechanism remains
speculative.

The epidemiology further weakens the genetic hypothesis. Gender
dysphoria diagnoses have increased dramatically in recent years,
particularly among adolescents.[^littman2018] Genetic traits do not
surge across a single generation. Social contagion does.

## The obstruction

Gender dysphoria involves two parts: a *self-image part* that holds
an image of the body, and a *dysphoric part* that looks inward toward
Self but sees the self-image instead—and reacts with distress. When
you are blended with the dysphoric part, its distress becomes your
reality: "I am in the wrong body."

In IFS therapy, the diagnostic question is: "Ask the part to look at
you and describe who it sees." A part may look toward Self but see
the self-image part instead. The therapist works to clear this
obstruction. When the part finally notices Self—compassion, calm,
curiosity—connection is established and the dysphoria can subside.

Medical interventions can help. Hormones and surgery are associated
with improved mental health and body
satisfaction.[^vandegrift2017][^jellestad2018][^devries2012]
This is real relief and should not be dismissed.
But the **why** matters: relief comes not from becoming who you should
have been, but from disrupting the alignment between the old self-image
part and the physical body. When the two no longer match, the self-image
becomes less convincing as an obstruction—and the dysphoric part has
a better chance of seeing past it to Self.

But loosening identification is not the same as transcending it. The
dysphoric part still looks inward and sees a self-image. Medical
intervention can redecorate what it sees. The deeper work is to help
the dysphoric part see past the self-image to Self.
Recognizing the Self is what can bring lasting relief.
