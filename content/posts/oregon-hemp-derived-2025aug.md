Subject: Request to Reconsider Ban on Synthetically Derived Cannabinoids Under HB 3000  
To: Sen.DianeLinthicum@oregonlegislature.gov, Rep.EmilyMcIntire@oregonlegislature.gov  
CC: Sen.DebPatterson@oregonlegislature.gov

I am writing as your constituent in [City], Oregon, to express my concerns about HB 3000's ban on synthetically derived cannabinoids by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC).

**The Current Problem**

The OLCC has banned all artificially derived cannabinoids based on health concerns, specifically worries over consumers ingesting or inhaling the residue of chemicals used to process CBD into other cannabinoids. While I understand the intent to protect consumers, this blanket prohibition creates several significant issues:

1. **Lack of Scientific Basis**: As OLCC hemp and processing compliance specialist Steven Crowley acknowledged, "We don't have any testing for any of the whole universe of chemical reagents that you could use to synthetically turn one cannabinoid into something else, or for any of the byproducts of that reaction." The solution should be developing appropriate testing standards, not blanket prohibition.

2. **Inconsistent Logic**: This approach is equivalent to banning lettuce because of occasional salmonella contamination instead of implementing proper safety testing and quality control measures. We don't ban produce when contamination occursâ€”we improve testing, traceability, and safety standards.

**A Better Path Forward**

Rather than prohibition, Oregon should:

- **Implement comprehensive testing requirements** for chemical reagents and byproducts used in cannabinoid synthesis
- **Establish clear safety standards** and manufacturing guidelines for synthetic cannabinoid production  
- **Require proper labeling** so consumers can make informed choices
- **Focus regulation on problematic products** rather than banning an entire category of compounds

**My Request**

I urge you to work with your colleagues to:

1. Review the lack of scientific basis for the current blanket ban
2. Advocate for evidence-based testing requirements instead of prohibition
3. Support legislation that allows synthetic cannabinoids with proper safety testing and oversight

Oregon should lead with smart regulation, not prohibition of federally legal products. I hope you will consider supporting a more balanced approach that protects consumers while preserving our state's hemp industry.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue further.
