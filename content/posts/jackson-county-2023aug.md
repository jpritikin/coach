Response to letter dated 09 Aug 2023 by Jackson County Commissioners CALL FOR THE REPEAL OF THE PROVISIONS ENACTED PURSUANT TO OREGON BALLOT MEASURE 110 (2020) order 192-23.[^jackson2023]

"Since Measure 110 was passed, there has been a dramatic increase in overdose deaths in Oregon. In 2020, there were 585 overdose deaths. In 2021, that number increased to 917."
- It is too early to evaluate the effect of Measure 110 on overdose deaths. "It wasn't until September of 2022 that the Oregon Health Authority announced funds had gone out to each county in the state."[^parfitt2023]

"Measure 110 has reduced the deterrent effect of drug laws, making it more likely that people would use drugs."
- Absurd. If punitive deterrents truly reduced the likelihood of drug use then the drug war would have been a success.

"Measure 110 has made Oregon a destination for hard drug users from other states."
- It's hard to be the first state with a compassionate public policy on drug use, but that's not a reason to backslide back to punitive prohibitionist policies. We should be studying how to improve care and encourage neighboring states to find more capacity for compassion.

"members of law enforcement and the criminal justice system have reported that Measure 110 has made it more difficult to motivate drug users to enter treatment."
- Personnel affiliated with the criminal justice system cannot be regarded as unbiased observers. Other law enforcement personnel argue that the government "should release drug offenders, expunge their records, and restore their civil rights."[^leap]

"Drug users are also more likely to be involved in drug trafficking" "the cost of criminal activity associated with drug use is significant"
- Sure, Measure 110 didn't go far enough. The best way to crush illegal drug trafficking is to distribute these same drugs through legal channels, controlled by medical personnel such as psychiatrists and doctors.[^leap]

"Measure 110 has also made it more likely that people will commit property crimes." "Hard drug use is often associated with public nuisance behavior, such as loitering, littering, aggressive panhandling, and increased criminal activity."
- Sure, Measure 110 didn't go far enough. Safe consumption facility are the most compassionate way to preempt property crime.[^beletsky2018]

"Measure 110's enforcement provisions have proved ineffectual. As of June 30, 2023, of the 5,299 tickets filed in Oregon Circuit Courts since Measure 110 went into effect, more than three-fifths resulted in a recipient failing to pay and facing no further penalties, according to the Oregon Judicial Department, found online, regarding Class E violations; most of the rest of the tickets were dismissed or are pending."
- I agree that the enforcement provisions could use refinement.

I respectfully request the commissioners rescind their 09 Aug 2023 letter.
