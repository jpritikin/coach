In nutrition science, the word *fiber* refers to the type of
carbohydrate that the body can't digest. This definition of fiber
is so different from the kind of fiber found in many plants that
they might as well be completely different words.

Coconut coir fibers are obtained from the outermost layer of the husk.
They are typically light brown in color, durable, and resistant to
water.

Indeed, these are a kind of fiber that your body cannot digest. You
cannot digest banana peals either. In nutrition science, the word
*fiber* refers to **eatible, appetizing** carbohydrates that the body
can't digest. Some of the highest fiber foods are not fibrous:

| food source | grams of fiber |
|-------------|----------------|
| 1 cup cooked lentils | 15 |
| raw avocado flesh from a medium avocado | 10 |
| 1 cup cooked rolled oats | 4 |
| 1 tablespoon chia seeds | 5 |

So whenever you hear the word *fiber* in a nutrition context,
picture **slimy gel** instead of coconut coir.
