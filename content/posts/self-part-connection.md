## Introduction

Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy emphasizes the client's Self as the core element for achieving healing.
The therapist typically acts as a supportive guide, facilitating connection between the client's various parts and their Self.
This connection is crucial for progress.
Without it, healing can be significantly slowed down or even impeded.
This is especially true for exiled parts, those that have been disconnected and burdened with emotional pain.

## Three Techniques

In introductory IFS training, we learn to facilitate one crucial aspect of this connection: the Self-to-part direction. 
The key question for the Self-to-part relationship is, "How do you feel toward the part?" or "How do you relate to the part?"
This is step 4 of the 6 Fs.
These questions reveal parts coming inbetween the Self-to-part connection.
By negotiating with these parts, the therapist can help them unblend and make space for the connection.
For many clients, this is sufficient.
Once the Self-to-part direction is clear then a circulation of energy is established.

However, some exiles express a profound distrust and have little curiosity to know the Self.
To get the connection established, it is helpful to address the part-to-Self direction as well.
The key question for the part-to-Self relationship is, "Can you ask the part to look at you and describe who it sees?" (Sweezy, 2023, pp 134-135).
If the client identifies a part then the therapist can negotiate with the part to unblend.
Once the other parts are out of the way then hopefully the target part can notice a little bit of Self energy.

This process can be seen as a dance.
Switch back and forth between Self-to-part and part-to-Self, identifying and clearing away parts that block connection.
Once both directions are relatively unobstructed, the therapist can encourage the client to slow down and allow Self energy to expand.
The "horse whisperer" analogy is helpful to paint a vivid picture of this strategy.
The horse represents the target part: distrustful, betrayed, hopeless, and holding painful memories.
The horse whisperer represents the Self.
The Self doesn't try to control parts, but instead radiates calm, compassion, and understanding.
Just like a horse whisperer doesn't force the horse to submit, the Self can't force parts to take an interest.
Instead, it uses a patient and steady presence to create a safe space where the target part can feel heard and understood.
This attracts the part to the Self, allowing it to receive grace.

## Discussion

Many presentations of the IFS model do not distinguish the directedness of the Self/part connection.
The Self-to-part direction is taught, but there is less coverage of the part-to-Self direction.
When a part responds in an unexpected way, digs in its heels, the IFS model as taught in IFS Level 1 provides little guidance.
The techniques presented here are not new, but I suspect that contextualizing them in this way is not widely understood.
I suggest that step 4 of the 6 Fs be explicitly expanded to include these three techniques.

By investing more care in building direct Self/part relationships, we can move beyond the limitations of questions like "How old does the part think you are?" and the notion of "updating" parts.
The question "How old does the part think you are?" is no longer needed because Self-like parts of whatever ages will get explicitly unblended, leaving only the ageless Self.
Futhermore, the notion of *updating a part* misconstrues what is really happening (Anderson, 2021, pp. 54-55).
What is really happening is that the target part is switching its relationship from a younger Self-like part to an older Self-like part.
Of course it is more efficient to establish a real part-to-Self connection instead of substituting one part-to-Self-like-part connection for another.

## Example

Bob, a 45-year-old cisginder, heterosexual, single, middle eastern man, was raised
by disinterested, abrasive parents. A 19-year-old part holds a lot of sadness, grief, and
anger about how his parents treated him.
*[To protect confidentiality, names and details have been changed.]*

**THERAPIST:** How do you feel towards that 19-year-old?  
**BOB:** I wish I could help him.  
**THERAPIST:** Okay so like a care and concern?  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Okay great, and is that 19-year-old looking at you?  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Does he notice your care and concern.  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** What's that like for him?  
**BOB:** Uh it's painful.  
**THERAPIST:** Can you say more?  
**BOB:** It's painful because for a brief moment it felt like a connection. He hasn't felt that in a long time.  
**THERAPIST:** Let him know that you're getting that: it's been a long time since you've been with him.  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** How does he react to that?  
**BOB:** He doesn't want to lose the feeling of being cared for, not being alone, feeling that he matters to somebody.  
**THERAPIST:** Does that make sense to you?  
**BOB:** Yeah, of course.  
**THERAPIST:** Yeah so can you let him know that it makes sense and that you're here and you're going to be with him from now on.  
**BOB:** I heard a response saying, "I don't believe you. How is this going to help with my anger, with my issues, with my problems?"  
*[The connection we thought that we had established is faulty. Maybe a therapist-pleasing part was interfering.]*  
**THERAPIST:** Oh, he's like, "This is bullshit. Do something real." ?  
**BOB:** Yeah, yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Okay, see if that 19-year-old has some curiosity about finding out who you are because I don't think he knows who you are yet.  
**BOB:** He said, "why?"  
**THERAPIST:** Say: "I'm Bob-who-is-not-a-part. I have the power to help all of Bob's parts, to heal them. If you have some curiosity then you can know me."  
**BOB:** Okay, yeah, he has curiosity.  
**THERAPIST:** Okay. How do you feel towards that 19-year-old now?  
**BOB:** Since the beginning I felt bad for him and I've wanted to help him.  
**THERAPIST:** Yeah, so can you deepen that feeling of care and compassion for the 19-year-old? Just maybe glance at him briefly to see if he's looking, but mostly just feel that care and compassion. Wait for him to notice it.  
**BOB:** He noticed it.  
**THERAPIST:** What's it like for him to notice it?  
**BOB:** Very apprehensive, very skeptical  
*[At least it is plausible that we're getting a candid report from the 19-year-old.]*  
**THERAPIST:** Okay, can you ask him why he's skeptical?  
**BOB:** From his experience, words can often be hollow.  
**THERAPIST:** Does that make sense?  
**BOB:** Oh, yeah  
**THERAPIST:** So let him know that you get that. Tell him that you're going to communicate without words.  
**BOB:** Okay  
**THERAPIST:** Now how do you feel towards him?  
**BOB:** I feel compassionate.  
**THERAPIST:** Okay, let that compassion expand. Is he noticing that at all?  
**BOB:** Yeah, he sees it okay.  
**THERAPIST:** What is he getting? What's he seeing?  
**BOB:** Well, when he looks at me, he sees someone desperate, hurting, alone, in pain. He can relate to me but at the same time I have compassion towards him. It seems reciprocated.  
**THERAPIST:** So it sounds like he's seeing the broken person part at the same time he's getting a little bit of the compassion and care.  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Okay, so can you ask that broken person part to separate from you a little bit and sit down next to you. Is that broken person part willing to give you some space? *(Request unblending)*  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Okay and how do you feel towards the 19-year-old now?  
**BOB:** Still compassion.  
**THERAPIST:** Okay. That 19-year-old, is it willing to look at you and not at the broken person part?  
**BOB:** I don't think there's anything for him to look at. This might have something to do with my lack of identity. I'm not sure. I don't know what's left. I'm trying to look through the eyes of the 19-year-old. I'm not sure what to look at. There's nothing there.  
**THERAPIST:** That 19-year-old is not seeing the compassion and the care?  
**BOB:** No, he feels the compassion.  
**THERAPIST:** So that's enough. That is Bob-who-is-not-a-part. Just let him know he's getting it. Encourage him to really feel into that. Do you still feel that compassion towards the 19-year-old?  
**BOB:** Yes  
**THERAPIST:** Now just give him a little bit more time. Really allow that feeling to deepen, the compassion and the care, so he has a good chance to really appreciate the depth of it.  
**BOB:** Okay  
**THERAPIST:** What's it like for him to appreciate Bob-who-is-not-a-part?  
**BOB:** It's a little confusing.  
**THERAPIST:** Is this new for him?  
**BOB:** Yeah  
**THERAPIST:** Let him know that you're getting that: that it's new and it could be confusing.  
**BOB:** Okay, yeah  
**THERAPIST:** How does he react?  
**BOB:** He wants to know how this is going to work.  
**THERAPIST:** That's better! *(Trust established!)*
