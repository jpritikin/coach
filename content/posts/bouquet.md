A vibrant bouquet of flowers in watercolor. The composition includes a variety of blooms, primarily featuring roses in different shades. There are yellow, orange, and deep red roses, each detailed with delicate petal layers. Accompanying the roses are white hydrangea clusters, adding a soft contrast to the vivid colors. Additionally, there are smaller pinkish flowers and green leaves interspersed throughout the bouquet, providing a lush and natural backdrop. The artist has used a delicate, almost translucent wash technique, allowing for a gentle blending of colors and soft edges that enhance the overall elegance and freshness of the floral arrangement. The piece exudes a sense of lightness and grace, capturing the beauty of the flowers with a refined touch.
