A black and white line art drawing of a dragon. The dragon is in mid-flight, its wings outstretched and its tail curled behind it. Its head is turned towards the viewer, and its mouth is open in a roar. The dragon's eyes are narrowed, and its claws are extended.

The style of the drawing is reminiscent of traditional Chinese dragon paintings. The lines are fluid and graceful, and the dragon is depicted in a powerful and majestic way.

Photo taken Dec 2016.
