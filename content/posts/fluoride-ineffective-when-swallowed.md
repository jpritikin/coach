The Director of The Centers For Disease Control's (CDC) Oral Health Division, Casey Hannan, fumbles during a deposition for the [TSCA Fluoride Lawsuit](https://fluoridealert.org/issues/tsca-fluoride-trial/fact-sheet/) when asked to provide documentation of the studies CDC relies on to support its claim that fluoride reduces tooth decay when ingested.

> A medical consensus of public health authorities around the world has considered water fluoridation at appropriate levels as a safe and effective means to prevent cavities on a community-wide scale. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed the fluoridation of drinking water as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century. There is little question that supplemental ﬂuoride strengthens teeth and reduces decay, but at what cost?
>
> In the last few years, there have been growing concerns about the adverse effects of fluoride on brain development. Given the National Toxicology Program’s draft conclusion that fluoride should now be presumed to be a cognitive neurodevelopmental hazard, a dispassionate and tempered discussion of fluoride’s potential neurotoxicity is warranted.

> Ironically, it was the anti-fluoridationists who were accused of their “anti-scientific” attitudes, but now it’s the pro-fluoridationists who may be ignoring evidence that doesn’t conform to their beliefs.
