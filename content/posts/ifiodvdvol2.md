# Change Your Conversation, Change Your Relationship

Intimacy from the Inside Out (IFIO) is **not** simple to learn.
I've been seeing couples for almost six months;
I feel like I'm just beginning to understand how to facilitate sessions.
On the Facebook group, I recently asked, "[How do tracking and courageous communication fit together? I mean, what does the intermediate stage look like where you are halfway between the two techniques?](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ifioinformeddiscussiongroup/permalink/714620243516285/)"
It was recommended that I study the videos available from https://vimeo.com/ondemand/ifiodvdvol2

I made the following sequence diagrams to make sure that I was following
exactly how the session was being facilitated.
I paraphrased and summarized, especially around the per-partner unblending.

## Andrew and Joanne

Tracking a couple's repetitive fight begins an unbending process which interrupts cyclical patterns of behaviors and deepens their conversation.

    Note over T: I want to help both of you see how this is not working.<br/>(Hope merchant)
    T->>A: What is the frustrated part saying to you?
    A->>T: She doesn't get it.
    T->>A: What do you do/say?
    A->>J: What is the problem that you don't<br/>hear what I am trying to tell you.
    T->>A: Sounds angry, sarcastic?
    A->>T: Yes
    T->>J: Do you know about this part of Andrew?
    J->>T: Yes
    T-->>J: Helps Joanne unblend
    T->>J: What do you do/say?

    J->>T: I want things to be more open and free.
    T->>J: Same dynamic?
    J->>T: Yes
    Note over T: Reflects back dynamic again. 20:10
    Note over T: Sounds like a painful dynamic. 21:10
    T->>A: What is the fear?
    A->>T: Nothing is going to change.
    T->>A: This part believes it's going to change<br/>the situation by getting angry.
    T->>J: Curious what you're noticing.
    J->>T: I had no idea.
    T->>J: As Andrew is softening and speaking more<br/>for the wish, how is that landing?
    J->>T: I feel my heart open a bit.
    T->>J: What is the hope/fear of your anger?
    J->>T: I need someone to ask, "How was your day?"
    T->>J: Fear of criticism?
    J->>T: Yes
    T->>J: What would it look like to get his attention?
    J->>T: Paints picture of getting attention.
    Note over T: Both of you are trying to get the other's attention. 30:40
    T->>A: How it is to hear the real communication? 32:10
    A->>T: Feels good.

## Josh and Sage

IFIO helps a wounding partner unblend enough to listen to the impact of her behavior and make an authentic apology.

    participant J as Josh
    participant T as Toni / Therapist
    participant S as Sage
    Note over T: We talk about repair. 3:30
    T->>J: Have you had apology?
    J->>T: Meh?
    S->>T: Somewhat, not too explicitly
    J->>T: Why didn't I notice?
    Note over T: Hard to move on if there hasn't been healing. 7:00
    S->>T: I understand why Josh was behaving erratically.
    Note over T: If there hasn't been repair then wouldn't it be hard to say
    T->>S: "I'm with you 100%." (to Josh)
    T->>J: "I trust you." (to Sage)
    Note over T: Does that make sense? 8:30
    J->>T: I'm guarded for her sake.
    Note over T: How to speak and listen differently? 11:42
    J->>T: Sounds good
    S->>T: Yeah
    T->>S: Is that a true "yes?" Because it may be difficult
    S->>T: Yeah, I can listen to him
    T->>S: Are you sure? 13:00
    Note over T: Promise that Sage will get a turn later 14:00
    Note over T: Big monologue to set up communication 17:00
    J->>S: The trust was a big one, that got hurt tremdously.
    J->>S: I want to be with you every minute of the day. But I can't.
    T->>S: What are you hearing. 18:00
    S->>T: "I was crushed."
    T->>J: Is that the essence of what you were saying?
    J->>T: Yeah.
    T->>S: What's it like to hear<br/>"I didn't know what I was going to do without you."
    S->>T: I get excited to know that someone could love me.
    S->>T: How can you do the things that you did to him?
    T->>S: Criticizing?
    T-->>S: Helps Sage unblend
    T->>S: What is the concern about hearing it?
    S->>T: Dunno, scared.
    S->>T: I have a belief that relationships are short-term.
    S->>T: But I want to stay, never wanted to leave.
    T->>J: How does this land with you? 21:50
    J->>T: I know you came from a tough background.
    J->>T: I know you love me.
    T->>J: How do you know that?
    J->>S: The looks that you give me.
    T->>J: You know she loves you?
    J->>T: Y
    S->>J: Yeah, I do.
    T->>J: Is there more than you want to tell her? 23:00
    J->>S: I have big plans with you.
    J->>S: Plans get shattered.
    T->>S: Are you able to stay?
    S->>T: It hurts.
    T->>S: What do you mean? Talk about your heart.
    S->>J: It wishes it could do better.
    S->>J: I'm not as scared of losing you.
    S->>J: I'm horrible at gift giving.
    S->>J: He is great at it [gift giving].
    J->>S: *Gives her a tissue*
    T->>S: Do you have to defend yourself? 26:50
    S->>T: No, I just want to let him know that I am trying.
    T->>S: When he talks about feeling hurt,<br/>does that make sense? 27:30
    S->>T: Yes
    T->>S: And do you feel sorry?
    S->>T: Yes
    T->>S: Have you expressed that?
    S->>T: Probably not enough.
    T->>S: Want to give it a go?
    S->>T: *Chuckles*
    T->>S: You're doing great.
    S->>J: I am truly sorry.
    T->>J: As you're listened to this, what's happening? 28:42
    J->>T: I hate seeing her like this.
    T->>J: We're going to ask that part to step back.
    Note over T: Was that a shame protector? I'm sketical!
    T->>J: Can you take the apology in?
    T->>J: Are there parts of you that can believe?
    J->>T: Yes and no
    T->>J: Yeah, this is a process over time.
    J->>S: This is the first time I've got a true apology.
    T->>J: What's that like? 29:50
    J->>S: It's nice to hear.
    T->>S: Notice what's happening in you.
    S->>T: I wish I had the strength to tell him before.
    T->>S: Things come when you're ready.
    T->>S: This is the beginning.
    T->>J: All the bad feelings aren't going away.
    Note over T: We do it a little bit at a time. 30:55
    T->>J: What's happening?
    J->>T: Reflecting. It's been almost a year.
    T->>J: Have you been waiting for it?
    J->>T: Yeah.
    T->>J: Is it meaningful to you?
    J->>T: Is it.
    J->>S: I appreciate you saying it. Means a lot.
    T->>S: What's happening for you?
    S->>T: A little relief.
    S->>T: Glad I was able to tell him without all the other crap.

## Allison and David

Creating safety for defensive protectors allows them to relax and hear requests for connection as an invitation instead of criticism.

    A->>T: David is not connecting.
    D->>A: Huh, what is that?
    A->>D: We don't connect. You're busy.
    D->>A: What do you want me to do?
    A->>D: It's so frustrating. I keep telling you
    D->>A: *Interrupting* You can't keep using the same
    A->>D: *Irritated*
    A->>D: I want more of you.
    D->>A: How I'm feeling?

    A->>D: I can see that.
    Note over T: Timeout. Reset.
    A->>T: We're really busy.
    A->>T: I want a deep connection with David.
    T->>A: Hold on. Something happened over there.
    T->>A: He made a facial expression<br/>then what happened?
    A->>T: I felt him do this: "What?"
    D->>A: I don't know what she wants from me.
    T->>A: We're starting. 3:40
    Note over T: Contracting for what to explore. 4:15
    D->>T: I don't understand.
    T->>D: Are you interested in learning<br/>more about what just happened?
    D->>T: Sort of.
    D->>T: If you're both looking at me, I don't want to do that.
    T->>D: I'm with you there. 5:00
    T->>D: It's not about stopping doing anything.
    Note over T: There is something that happens between you.<br/>Do you recognize this?
    D->>T: It happens a lot.
    Note over T: Are you interested in understanding<br/>what's happening between you?
    D->>T: I'm interested in it not happening again.
    T->>D: Yeah, okay.
    T->>A: Sounds like you're both in agreement?
    A->>T: Um hum.
    D->>T: *Nods*
    A->>T: I'm wanting him to talk more.
    T->>A: Yeah. One of the things you're wishing<br/>for is that he would talk more to you?
    A->>T: Right, yeah.
    A->>D: I was wondering if he had something<br/>else he wanted to talk about today?
    T->>D: Before we do anything, how is it to be here?
    D->>T: We've been married a long time.
    D->>T: It's working. Why do we need to mess with it?
    T->>D: Allison is telling you that there<br/>is something wrong with you.
    D->>T: Yeah!
    T->>D: Are you open to hearing from Allison?
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>A: Are you available to talk more?
    A->>T: Sure.
    T->>D: Are you available to listen to her?
    D->>T: I just don't want to be criticized.
    T->>D: I got that.
    T-->>D: Helps David unblend the part that<br/>is afraid of being criticized.
    Note over T: If I feel like parts are taking<br/>over, I'm going to slow everything down.
    D->>T: Okay.
    T->>A: I want you to notice what's<br/>happening in your body.
    A->>T: I'm more calm.
    A->>D: I think we're at a different phase. 15:00
    A->>D: It's our precious time to be together.
    A->>T: I noticed him shift.
    T->>A: Do you want to get curious about that?
    A->>D: Did something just happen?
    Note over D: *Rolls his neck* 15:55
    D->>A: I want this to work out too.
    D->>A: When you talk about going deeper,<br/>I have no idea what you're talking about.
    D->>A: I just go, "oh, shit"
    Note over T: Okay, we're going to hold on there. Hold on.<br/>Notice what's happening in your body.
    Note over T: This is what happens at home?
    A->>T: *Nods*
    Note over D: Yeah, and I get worried about ...
    T->>D: Yeah. And then we pull back.
    Note over T: And then you both pull back?
    D->>T: *Nods*
    Note over T: I want to help Allison understand<br/>what happened when she said "Go deeper"
    D->>T: *Nods*
    T-->>D: Helps David unblend
    T->>D: What actually happened when you heard "go deeper"?
    T->>D: Stay with me.
    D->>T: It feels like shit. 19:05
    T->>D: Can you say more?
    D->>A: I don't know what you're talking about.
    T->>D: I'm going to help her talk about<br/>what she means by that.
    T->>D: I do hear the plea: "I don't know<br/>what you mean by that."
    D->>T: I feel like I'm failing at it.
    T->>D: Yeah, there is a part of you that says, "I am failing."
    D->>T: Yeah.
    Note over T: What if the part that says, "I am failing," didn't pop in? 20:15
    D->>T: That would be great.
    T-->>D: Helps David unblend
    T->>A: *Contracting for individual work with David*
    Note over A: I didn't realize David felt that way.<br/>I don't mean for that to happen.
    T-->>A: Helps Allison unblend
    A->>T: I'm curious.
    T->>D: Focus on the part.<br/>What are you noticing about it?
    D->>T: I really do not like it.
    T->>D: There's a part that says, "I don't want you to feel this."
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>D: Say "hi" to that one
    D->>T: *Waves "hi"*
    T->>D: Does it make sense that you have this part?
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>D: Can you recognize that as a part?
    D->>T: *Nods* I felt this way a lot when I was a kid.
    D->>A: When I got married, I didn't feel it as much.
    T->>D: Something about your relationship<br/>helped that part of you.
    T->>D: Can you let it know that?
    D->>T: *Nods*
    T->>D: What else does it want you to know?
    D->>T: I was not going to feel this way anymore.
    T->>D: A part made a vow?
    D->>T: Yes. 27:55
    T->>D: And it doesn't like that you're feeling it now.
    D->>T: No.
    T->>D: Yeah, that makes sense to me.
    D->>A: She's the one who made me come in here.
    A->>D: *Smiles*
    T->>D: We're going to change focus to the part<br/>that doesn't want you to feel it.
    D->>T: *Nods*
    T->>D: How has it tried to help you not feel this?
    D->>A: Do you know?
    A->>D: *Shrugs* No.
    Note over D: Really busy
    T->>D: Really busy might be one way.
    A->>D: That's it. You do-do-do
    Note over D: Yeah. I coach baseball.
    A->>D: You don't stop.
    D->>A: I do some consulting.
    A->>D: I try to get you to stop.
    D->>T: That's often pretty good.
    Note over T: Let's appreciate that you have done<br/>some extraordinary things in your life.
    T->>D: Maybe one reason is so you<br/>don't have to feel this feeling.
    D->>T: I like to work hard.
    T->>D: Can you see the connection between the two?
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>D: Can you take a minute and honor<br/>the part of you that has worked so hard.
    Note over D: It did a good job.
    A->>D: *Laughing warmly*
    T->>D: It deserves some kind of medal.
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>D: Take a moment to acknowledge the hard work.
    A->>D: *Reaches out to touch David affectionately.*
    Note over D: Retiring was bad for me.<br/>Kids growing up was bad for me.
    T->>A: Does this make sense to you.
    A->>T: Very much.
    Note over D: Now, I'm not good at this.<br/>That's what I keep hearing.
    T->>D: It sounds like that part is<br/>speaking for itself right now?
    D->>T: Yeah.
    T->>D: This makes sense to me,<br/>that this part is now floudering.<br/>Does that makes sense to you?
    Note over D: Yeah, I'm just clueless.
    T->>A: It makes sense to you as well?
    A->>T: Yeah, I didn't know that.
    T->>D: Maybe that part of you floudering around,<br/>can hear its distress being understood.<br/>What is that like?
    D->>A: I just need you to go really slowly.<br/>I don't know how to do this.
    T->>D: Are you asking for her help?
    D->>T: Yeah.
    A->>D: You're doing great.<br/>This is what I'm talking about.
    D->>A: THIS?! Seriously?
    A->>D: *Nods* You're being real.
    D->>A: *Nods*
    Note over T: It's hard to believe that this<br/>is what she is really wanting from me.
    D->>T: *Nods*
    D->>A: When you say 'real' or 'deep',<br/>I have no idea what that means.
    D->>A: When we walk through it like this, it<br/>just feels like this weird kind of conversation.
    D->>A: So you want me to be weird and bad? *Laughing*
    A->>D: It's no "shoulds," it's beautiful to me.
    A->>D: It's intimate. You feel present.
    T->>A: And Allison, this is an exploration.
    T->>D: I'm hearing, David, you're saying, "this<br/>is all new to me. I don't know how to do this and you do."
    T->>A: Did you hear that as well?
    A->>T: Yes.
    T-->>A: Helps Allison unblend
    T->>A: What's that like that you were getting<br/>something that you were wanting and needing?
    Note over A: It's awesome. It's so great to see<br/>him go to that deep level and be real.
    T->>A: What does it mean when you say, "deep level and be real"?
    Note over A: It's presence. It's connecting. Intimacy. Slowing down.
    Note over T: *Reflects back* Is that true?
    A->>T: Yeah.
    T->>A: Say more about that.
    T-->>A: Helps David unblend so he can listen
    A->>D: This means everything to me. When you<br/>share, that's what I mean by showing up.
    D->>A: Yeah.
    T->>D: What's happening in your body?
    D->>T: Feels good.
    A->>D: When you share those things about<br/>the past, I felt closer to you.
    D->>A: That's pretty scary.
    A->>D: Yeah.
    T->>D: I want you to notice that place in<br/>your diaphram. What's happening there?
    D->>T: It's not really there.
    A->>D: *Smiling*
    T->>D: Notice that.
    D->>T: *Nods*
    D->>A: *Affectionately touches Allison's leg.*
