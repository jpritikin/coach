I had lunch at La Fondita 2 (3330 Center St NE, Salem, OR 97301) today at around 11 a.m.
A man I had barely met paid for my burrito. 🌯
He didn't mention his name, and the restaurant staff didn't know him either.
Apparently, I was the accidental beneficiary of a random act of kindness.
I'm not sure whether this has ever happened to me before. ♥️
