# Sex Education ⚤

As you probably know, sex education at American public schools is
narrowly focused on basic anatomy. My parents, for whatever reason,
did not provide much supplemental information. The unstated sentiment was
that I should figure it out for myself. On one hand, the minimum
competencies are mostly innate. My daughter was born in 2004. On the
other hand, such a rich area of behavioral affordances prompts much
more detailed exploration.

## Annotated bibliography

### History

Despite some fictional elements,
[Hysteria 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria_(2011_film)) is a charming
alternate history of the vibrator.

The invention of the polygraph inspired a remarkable film, [Professor Marston & the Wonder Women 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Marston_and_the_Wonder_Women).

Thomas Maier wrote a [history of the first scientific investigation of human sexuality](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/thomas-maier/masters-of-sex/9780465079995/). The associated miniseries, [Masters of Sex 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Sex), incorporates some fictional elements that well complement the extraordinary story.

### Not too intellectual, erotic, disgusting, tragic

I don't consider myself much of a connoisseur, but no treatment of sex
is complete without such a specimen: [Love 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_(2015_film))
