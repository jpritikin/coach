# Exercise

Exercise is important for physical and mental health.  For people who
have already settled on favorite activities, such as golf or figure
skating, keep it up. There is no special reason that you need to
change.  However, not everybody already has strong activity
preferences. The question that we try to answer here is:

What is the most enjoyable way to exercise?
{{% /hint %}}

## Criteria

I am proud to say that I have collaborated on seminal research in this area.[^pritikin2022]
Our results point to the importance of

- complex activities that take place in complex environments,
- unpredictable activities that require a lot of skill to master,
- activities that offer a lot of scope for creativity;
- activities that feel high stakes; and
- activities that present novel situations.

In addition, I think it is prudent to require
- low probability of injury or concussion, and
- a minimal amount of required equipment or built environment.

Although the research has not been done yet, I would also weigh facets that support group flow.[^sawyer2007]

Game design is a closely related area of study.[^nguyen2020]

It's not super enjoyable (for me), but it helps set you up for success.
I got into weights late in life. I'm still trying to grow out of the nerd physique stereotype. ðŸ¤£

Hopefully inverted positions ðŸ™ƒ do not increase the risk of glaucoma![^jasien2015]
