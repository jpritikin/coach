# My opinion

In real life, I am highly opinionated about diverse content areas.

This area of my website is the safe space for me to broadcast my opinions.

This is in contrast to how you will find me as an IFS Practitioner.
As an IFS Practitioner, I attend
to structure and process while maintaining indifference to content.
I believe that a good counselor is extremely neutral, to encourage the
client's inner system to lead, like the illustration below.
