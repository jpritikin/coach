# My opinion

In real life, I am highly opinionated about diverse content areas.

{{< hint info >}}
This area of my website is the safe space for me to broadcast my opinions.
{{< /hint >}}

## No Secrets

In my previous career,
I contributed to science and free and open source software, and I am proud of that.
I continue to carry some of the same ethical principles forward as a counselor.
Specifically, I reject secrecy in the sense that I have
no paywall or subscription for my website content. I have and
continue to put effort into clearly presenting everything that I have learned,
gratis.

## Counseling ‚â† Telling My Opinions

As an IFS Practitioner, I attend
to structure and process while maintaining indifference to content.
I believe that a good counselor is extremely neutral ‚öñÔ∏è, to encourage the
client's inner system to lead.

- The rock balanced atop of the pile of rocks represents the client.
- The environment represents my emotional warmth and support.
- My job is to keep you, the client, well held and protected. ü´∂üèº

You should not hear any unsolicited opinions from me when I am working with you as your counselor.
If you do think you hear me express an opinion, I want to know about it. üôä
