# Opinion

In real life, I am highly opinionated about diverse content areas.

This area of my website is the safe space for me (mostly Joshua) to broadcast my opinions. 🤓

Maybe you trust me. I can help you navigate the age of hyperspecialization.[^millgram2015]

## No Secrets

In my previous career,
I contributed to science and free and open source software. 📖✍🏼
I continue to carry some of the same ethical principles forward as a counselor.
Specifically, I reject secrecy in the sense that I have
no paywall or subscription for my website content. 📬

## Counseling ≠ Telling Opinions

As an IFS Practitioner, I attend to structure and process while holding content lightly.
I believe that a good counselor is extremely impartial ⚖️, thereby inviting the client's inner system to lead. 🗽

- The rock balanced atop of the pile of rocks represents the client.
- The environment represents my emotional warmth and support.
- My job is to keep you, the client, well held and protected. 🫶🏼

You should not hear any unsolicited opinions from me when I am working with you as your counselor.
If you think you hear me express an opinion, I want to know about it. 🙊
