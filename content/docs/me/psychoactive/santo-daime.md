# Santo Daime

Among many other effects, sensitivity to posture and gesture are
greatly enhanced by [5-HT2A receptor agonists]({{< relref "psychoactive" >}}#serotonin) such as daime.[^garrison2016]
I have made some study of static poses that align with
the current of reverence. üî¨ Before detailing my findings,
I want to emphasize that I have not made an exhaustive search.
There may be other postures and gestures worth exploring. Furthermore,
I have not studied dynamic poses
(e.g., mimicking the flapping and soaring of eagle wings with your arms ü™Ω).
The postures listed here are intended as static poses
to be held steadily for a few minutes at a time.
The reason that the title of this article is [*Santo Daime*](https://maps.org/psychedelic-parenthood-a-new-ancestral-way/) and not *Postures and Gestures*
is because these poses have much greater significance when implemented
by a whole group of people simultaneously in careful coordination.
Posing solo is a bit self-indulgent.

## Doubts?

Maybe you read through this page and you're skeptical.
Drink more daime. üçµ

## The Current of Reverence

The analogy that I am trying to invoke is with electrical current
or water flowing through a pipe. üåä Here, the substance that is
flowing is *reverence*, and with enough daime,
it feels almost tangible. Just as with electricity or water,
there is a direction of flow. You receive reverence,
it flows through you, and then you can direct it away from you.
An arbitrary careless posture does not necessarily obstruct the current of reverence,
but specific intentional postures can increase the conductance and encourage the flow. üö∞

## Component-wise

Before I list ensemble poses,
I present the optimal positions of each relevant joint.

### Receiving

1. Spine extension
| action | sitting | standing | evaluation |
|---|---|---|---|
| neutral   | ![spine sitting neutral](spine-sitting-neutral.webp) | ![spine standing neutral](spine-standing-neutral.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |
| extension | ![spine sitting extension](spine-sitting-extension.webp) | ![spine standing extension](spine-standing-extension.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

    When sitting, there isn't much difference in outward appearance, but I feel like I am arching my back. I cannot avoid lifting my chin, but the important part is to arch the back.

1. Rotate the wrist away from neutral
| action | before | after | evaluation |
|---|---|---|---|
| pronation<br/>(palm down) | ![pronation](wrist-pronation-before.webp) | ![pronation](wrist-pronation-after.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |
| neutral | ![neutral](wrist-straight.webp) | ![neutral](wrist-straight.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |
| supination<br/>(palm up) | ![supination](wrist-supination-before.webp) | ![supination](wrist-supination-after.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |
1. Pinky extension
| before | after | evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| ![pinky](pinky-before.webp) | ![pinky](pinky-after.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

    The nearby fingers are hard to isolate from the pinky extension, but the pinky is what I'm thinking about.

### Sending

4. Wrist extension
| action | illustration | evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| extension | ![wrist extension](wrist-extension.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |
| neutral | ![wrist neutral](wrist-neutral.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |
| flexion | ![wrist flexion](wrist-flexion.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |
1. Palm direction   
Energy is emitted perpendicular to the palm surface. Your palm can be
aimed at the center of the sal√£o, perpendicular to the center
of the sal√£o (e.g. ceiling, floor, or along the circumference),
or back toward yourself.
In general, the most delicate direction is toward the center
of the sal√£o because it can look as if you
are aiming across the sal√£o at other people.
If you are aiming across the sal√£o then you
must have consent; it should be an orchestrated collective action.
If you are aiming elsewhere then consent is less important.

## Pose Ensembles

None of these pose ensembles incorporate all of the components mentioned above,
but all of them incorporate some of the components. I also point out similar
poses that miss opportunities to improve the conductivity of reverence.

### Pose: Umbrella

| sitting | evaluation |
|---|---|
| ![umbrella](pose-umbrella.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- Wrist and pinky extension
- Wrist pronation
- Palm facing ceiling

Variations:
- Both arms ("double umbrella"?)
- Different angle (shoulder joint can rotate about 90 degrees so play with that)

Of course, it is challenging to keep an arm (or arms) elevated for a long duration,
but five minutes is feasible.

### Pose: Feather ruffle

| sitting | evaluation |
|---|---|
| ![hug](pose-hug.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- Wrist and pinky extension
- Wrist supination
- Palm facing self

The wrist extension prevents my hands from touching my arms or the shirt.

### Pose: Classical worship

| sitting | standing | evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| ![pose1](pose1-sitting.webp) | ![pose1](pose1-standing.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- Spine extension
- Wrist supination & extension
- Pinky extension
- Palm facing the center of the sal√£o

While I feel the inner effect of the pose,
my external appearance looks a little bit odd (to me, at least :-).
Compare with some artistic renditions:

| sitting(-ish) | standing |
|---|---|
| [![Lance Brown](LanceBrown1.webp)](https://www.paintedchrist.com/painted-christ-speed-painting-store/jesus-christ-praying-garden-of-gethsemane) | ![Woman](woman-202304.webp) |

The man (left) is a speed painting by Lance Brown.
The woman (right) is a photo of artwork from the Ashland OR Santo Daime sal√£o.
She lacks spine extension, her wrist extension is faint, and her pinky extension is washed out by the flow of energy, but otherwise it is almost a great example.

| standing | evaluation |
|---|---|
| ![pose1](pose1-dull.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |

- Wrist neutral/flexion instead of extension
- Pinky neutral instead of extension
- No spine extension

The following pose is a minor variation (different hand position) but
otherwise the same:

| standing | evaluation |
|---|---|
| ![pose1](pose1-high.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- Spine extension
- Wrist and pinky extension
- Palm facing ceiling

With hands raised, this pose is too taxing to hold for more than a brief time.

### Pose: Holding a Flower

| concept | actual | evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| ![flower](pose-flower-concept.webp) | ![flower](pose-flower.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- Wrist and pinky extension
- Palm facing perpendicular to the center of the sal√£o

In the concept image, there is a flower superimposed over my arm/hand.
Moving the fingers is like wiggling the petals.

## Standing-only Pose Ensembles

### Pose: Shark fin

| Pose | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| ![back](pose-back.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |
| ![back dull](pose-back-dull.webp) | ![no](no.webp) |

- Wrist and pinky extension
- Palm facing perpendicular to the center of the sal√£o

### Pose: Hands with opposite twist

| Closed | Open | evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| ![twist closed](pose-twist-closed.webp) | ![twist open](pose-twist-open.webp) | ![yes](yes.webp) |

- One wrist supinated, the other pronated
- Wrist and pinky extension (at least one hand)
- Palm facing palm or perpendicular to the center of the sal√£o (ceiling and floor)

The `open` and `closed` variations just indicate whether the palms are facing or not.

## Notes

[^garrison2016]: In contrast, in an ordinary state of mind, pose seems to have little psychological effect. See Garrison, K. E., Tang, D., & Schmeichel, B. J. (2016).
