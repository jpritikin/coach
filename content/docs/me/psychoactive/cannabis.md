# Cannabis

## Introduction

I don't know much about [cannabinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid).
However, this fascinating family of substances deserves thorough exploration.
The internet is rife with unverified folklore and dubious claims about cannabis.
Despite the identification of over 100 cannabinoids in cannabis, our understanding of these compounds remains limited.
There is a mournful poverty of peer-reviewed cannabinoid research.
Many individual cannabinoids have not been fully characterized, and the potential synergistic effects of various combinations are largely unexplored.[^entourage]
Given this scarcity of reliable information, personal exploration becomes a valuable, albeit limited, source of knowledge.
Here I present my evolving ideas about cannabinoids, primarily based on self-experimentation and a skeptical analysis of other sources of information.

## Background

Medicinal use of cannabis dates back at least 5,000 years.
Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive in cannabis.
Commonly reported effects of THC include relaxation, euphoria, increased appetite, pain reduction, drowsiness, and occasionally, anxiety.
CBD (Cannabidiol) is another widely known cannabinoid.
It is non-psychoactive and widely studied for its potential therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties.

## Routes of administration

Inhalation is probably the most widely known route of administration because it is so conspicuous.

- Inhalation (Smoking or Vaporizing): 
  - Pros: Rapid onset of effects (usually within minutes)
  - **Cons**: Respiratory irritation (especially with smoking), short duration of effects, imprecise dosing, must avoid acetate forms[^acetates]
- **Oral Ingestion** (Edibles, Oils, Capsules):
  - **Pros**: Longer-lasting effects (4-8 hours typically), no respiratory risks, discreet consumption, precise dosing
  - Cons: Slow onset (30 minutes to 2 hours)
- Sublingual (Tinctures, Sprays):
  - Pros: Relatively fast onset (15-45 minutes), bypasses first-pass liver metabolism
  - **Cons**: Hard to segregate from oral ingestion
- Topical (Creams, Balms) or Transdermal (Patches): This is **not comparable** because the effect is localized and non-intoxicating.

### Why prefer a longer duration?

The extended duration aligns well with those seeking a more profound, intimate experience, allowing for deeper introspection or prolonged relaxation.
This lengthier effect discourages casual or frequent use, potentially promoting a more mindful and respectful relationship with the substance.
However, the delayed onset of ingested cannabis makes accurate dosing crucial, as miscalculations can lead to uncomfortable experiences lasting several hours.
Users must carefully consider their dose and timing, as the extended duration can become problematic if unexpected obligations arise.

## The THC:CBD Ratio

THC is often taken in concert with another cannabinoid like CBD.
When I talk about THC, I implicitly mean both THC and CBD at 1:1 ratio.
However, the intensity of the experience is mostly a function of the amount of THC.
I'm not sure exactly how much CBD is required to complement the THC.
You definitely want enough CBD and extra isn't a problem.

Do not take THC without CBD.
The combination of THC and CBD feels completely different than either molecule ingested alone.

I am skeptical about the following infographic, but I tentatively agree that a ratio of 1:1 is a good place to start.
The same ratio applies for both Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC.

## Δ8-THC vs Δ9-THC

The subjective experiences are extremely similar.
The main difference is that Δ8-THC is emotionally soothing while Δ9-THC is emotionally potentiating.
I might even draw the analogy that Δ8-THC is to psilomethoxin as Δ9-THC is to psilocybin.
If you haven't tried THC, start with Δ8-THC before trying Δ9-THC.

For occasional use, tolerance half-life seems to be about two days.
There is likely cross-tolerance because both substances are [CB1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_1) agonists.

## Cannabinol (CBN)

CBN (without CBD) is recommmended for sleep.[^bonn-miller2024]
How does the subjective effect differ with and without CBD?
What about combining CBN with THC?

CBN used alone has no cross-tolerance with THC.

## Pending further self-experimentation

- HHC (hexahydrocannabinol) feels like Δ8-THC, but only the effects of Δ8-THC from the neck up. Weird.
I don't see the application.
  It seems strict inferior to THC, but maybe HHC is great in combination with something else.

- The effects (if any) of CBG (cannabigerol) are subtle. I haven't figured it out yet. Maybe CBG is great in combination with something else.
