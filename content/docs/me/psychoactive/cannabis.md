# Cannabis/Hemp

Cannabis offers an extraordinary variety of psychoactive chemicals
that interact in complex ways.[^russo2019] The two most important
molecules are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
Cannabis can facilitate many different kinds of experiences, some
psychedelic.

Whether a substance has a psychedelic effect is, in part,
a matter of intention, not an inherent property of the substance.[^wolinsky2023]

"CBD ... antagonise[s] some undesirable effects of THC including intoxication, sedation and tachycardia, while contributing analgesic, anti-emetic, and anti-carcinogenic properties..."[^russo2006] However, there is little research on the psychological effect of THC:CBD ratios that are mostly CBD (1:50 or more extreme).[^zeyl2020]

## Administration Protocol

Cannabis is less interesting than other psychoactives because its effects tend to be unpredictable.
In a quest to obtain more repeatable, consistently psychedelic effects, I came up with the following protocol.

- Daytime: Cannabinoids can make one pleasantly sleepy, but if you sleep then you aren't fully enjoying the effects.
- Fasting: There are cannabinoid receptors throughout the digestive system. Eating would add a confounding factor and make the experience less reproducible.
- Ingested: Longer duration of effect compared with inhalation, and does not injure the lungs.[^osullivan2021] Onset is 30 min to 2 hours. Full effect peaks within 4 hours. Effects can last up to 12 hours after use. Some residual effects can last up to 24 hours.
- One week between trips: Ingested cannabinoids take days to drain out of your system. An attempted trip on the day immediately following an administration session will be blocked by built-up tolerance.[^devinsky2014]
- No extra oil: Cannabinoids are soluble in oil, but that doesn't mean you need a lot of oil to optimize absorption. Look for Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) style extractions.

### CBD isolate powder

Try both 250mg and 500mg. Does not produce a psychedelic experience. The
effect is similar to [candle treatment]({{< relref "candle" >}}).

### Full spectrum hemp extract + CBD isolate powder

Try 250mg CBD from full spectrum hemp extract + 250mg CBD isolate
powder. Produces a gentle psychedelic experience using only hemp extract
(less than 0.3% THC).  It seems you only need trace amounts of THC to obtain a psychedelic effect.
