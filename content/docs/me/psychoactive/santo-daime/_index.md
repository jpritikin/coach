Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew used by various indigenous groups in the Amazon.
Incorporating ayahuasca as a sacrament, Santo Daime is a syncretic religion founded in Brazil in the 1930s.
While traditional use of ayahuasca often emphasizes individual exploration, Santo Daime emphasizes group synchrony and communitas.[^turner2012]
I've attended Santo Daime works for about two years (as of Jan 2024).
There are a number of areas that I think could be improved.

### What is special about the group experience?

Before suggesting improvements, I want to underline what is revolutionary about Santo Daime: the group experience.

The force of the daime draws one's attention to the present and opens up more opportunity for choice.
When group behavior is the reference point,
your conscious choice to harmonize with the group can help relieve varieties of self-centeredness including feeling entitled, lack of connection, and internal conflict.
In contrast, entitlement and arrogance are a risk when intention is limited to individual exploration.
The group experience is a hugely significant innovation.
If your experience of psychedelics is only individual exploration then you have not had a chance to appreciate their full transformative potential.

### On Lyrics and Prayers

Some people seem to enjoy talking to a higher power, expressing faith, or strengthening their religious identity.
Personally, these types of activities do not appeal to me.
Perhaps I have been traumatized by placebo sacrament religions (and cults) where these activities feel fake.
The only belief I need: daime can facilitate a direct experience of the Divine.
However, the lyrics and prayers serve another purpose.
They are important because they facilitate precise synchronization among the group, not just physically and physiologically but in the imaginal space.
Since we have to recite something to achieve this degree of synchronization,
what we recite might as well be something religious (i.e., unobjectionable).
As far as I can tell, the preponderance of Christian and African religious material reflects nothing more than a historical accident.
It would be nice if the hymns included more diversity in religious tradition.

### Posture and Gesture ðŸª½

There is too much to say! [Visit here]({{< relref "posture" >}})

### Smudging

Smudging is a ceremonial practice used in various Indigenous cultures (primarily North American) for spiritual cleansing and purification.
The purpose is to cleanse people, places, or objects of negative energy, promote healing, and create sacred space.
This is traditionally accomplished by burning dried herbs or smudge sticks (i.e., incense).
The smoke is fanned with feathers or hands with specific intentions and prayers.

Unfortunately [burning incense has been found to generate about four times the particulate matter as burning cigarettes](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-side-effects-of-burning-incense/).
Worse, the incomplete combustion results in carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds like benzene and formaldehyde.
Feeling purified? Really?
Just say "no" to smudging. ðŸ§¯

### Ginger ðŸ«š

Some ayahuasca traditions regard purging (i.e., vomito) as necessary and even powerful part of the healing process.
Some even add emetic agents to the brew![^beyer2008]

- **Physical Cleansing**: Many traditions view purging as a crucial element of physical cleansing, eliminating negative energies, toxins, and blockages from the body, allowing for deeper spiritual and emotional healing.
- **Psychological Release**: Purging is often seen as a form of emotional catharsis, releasing pent-up emotions, traumas, and negativity, leading to deeper self-awareness and personal growth.
- **Spiritual Transformation**: In some traditions, purging is considered a symbolic death and rebirth experience, purging the "old self" to make way for spiritual transformation and renewal.

While Santo Daime acknowledges the potential cleansing and cathartic effects of purging, it's not considered a central focus of the experience.
If some traditions use an emetic, why not offer an optional antiemetic in Santo Daime?
Why not make ginger capsules[^marx2015] available and encourage their use?
Maybe we should be open to pharmauasca?[^aicher2024]

### Harmonies?

Sung harmonies weaves two or more vocal lines together to create a richer, fuller sound than could be achieved with a single voice.
Here's a breakdown of what goes into singing harmonies:

Basics:

* **Multiple notes:** Instead of just one pitch, at least two different notes are sung simultaneously. These notes might be close together (like thirds or sixths) or further apart (like octaves or fifths).
* **Pleasing sound:** The combination of notes should sound good together, not jarring or dissonant. This depends on the musical context and style.
* **Complementing the melody:** Harmony parts typically interweave with the main melody, providing support, adding counterpoint, or even mirroring the melody's emotional journey.

Types of harmonies:

* **Simple two-part harmonies:** Often involve singing a third or sixth above or below the melody.
* **More complex harmonies:** Can involve multiple singers and use various intervals and melodic patterns, building intricate layers of sound. Think barbershop quartets, gospel choirs, or jazz vocal groups.
* **Passing tones and suspensions:** These are temporary notes that add brief moments of tension or surprise before resolving back to a consonant harmony.

Benefits of singing harmonies:

* **Enhances the emotional impact of the music:** Adds depth, dimension, and expressiveness to the song.
* **Creates a fuller, richer sound:** Makes the music feel more complete and polished.
* **Showcases vocal skill and musicianship:** Demonstrates a singer's understanding of music and ability to blend their voice with others.

So why don't we do it (more) in Santo Daime?
