# The Cannabinol Family

## Introduction

[![CBN](cannabinol.webp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol)

Cannabinol is available in three flavors: cannabinol (CBN), acetylated cannabinol (CBN-O), and cannabinphorol (CBN-P).
The cannabinol family (without other cannabinoids) is recommmended for sleep.[^bonn-miller2024][^kolobaric2024]
For sedation and analgesia, cannabinol can be used **daily** (seemingly there is no tolerance).
There is little cross-tolerance with THC.

## Atomic Model Analogy

The cannabinol family can be conceptualized as an atomic structure with electron shells surrounding a sleep-promoting nucleus. At the core lies the sedation, relaxation, pain relief, and difficulty thinking shared by all cannabinol variants. Surrounding this nucleus are two distinct electron shells that correspond to different aspects of the experience.

The inner shell, activated by CBN-P, contributes a tranquil, stable anchor of activation. It grabs and holds the attention.

The outer shell, activated by CBN or CBN-O, contributes a pleasant fizzy cloud of activation. It does not the grab the attention firmly. CBN-O activates this outer shell more 2-3 times more efficiently than CBN.

For optimal therapeutic benefits, activate both shells simultaneously. That is, combine CBN-P with either CBN or CBN-O to create a complete electron shell configuration that maximizes the sleep-promoting potential.

This model elegantly explains the dose threshold phenomenon. Once a shell is fully "populated" with electrons (reaching maximum intensity), additional dosing only extends the duration rather than intensifying effects. This is similar to how electron shells have specific capacities. The compound's effects persist into waking only when doses exceed certain thresholds.

| Which | Full Intensity | Persists Past Waking |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------  |
| CBN | 150mg | 0.5-1g |
| CBN-O | 50mg | 125-200mg |
| CBN-P | 4mg | 8mg |

If you expect stubborn insomnia, you can take a high dose (e.g., 8mg CBN-P), but you might want to start 3-4 hours earlier than you would otherwise.

## In Blends

Counterintuitively, when paired with THC, CBN and CBN-O are 1:1 interchangable with indistinguishable phenomenology.
The difference in potency only applies when CBN/CBN-O is used *without* THC.

## Troubleshooting

{{% hint info %}}
I wrote this before I got a hold of CBN-P. CBN-P is pretty good at grabbing the attention without the help of kanna.
{{% /hint %}}

CBN isn't a panacea.
If you are in heart-space then the CBN effect is too weak.
To really enjoy CBN, you need to get to head-space and out of heart-space.
Kanna is a promising solution.
Co-administer kanna and CBN.
You don't need much kanna.
About 1-2 mg worth of total primary alkaloids will do.
The trick is to find the appropriate energy/relaxation balance.
Search for a feeling analogous to Δ8-THC:CBN:CBD 4:1:1.
Kanna isn't as potent as THC, but the big advantage for this application is that it lacks a tolerance effect for daily use.
Kanna peaks in an hour, just when CBN is coming online.
