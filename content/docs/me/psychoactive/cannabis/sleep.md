# The Cannabinol Family

## Introduction

[![CBN](cannabinol.webp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol)

Cannabinol is available in three flavors: cannabinol (CBN), acetylated cannabinol (CBN-O), and cannabinphorol (CBN-P).
The cannabinol family (without other cannabinoids) is recommmended for sleep.[^bonn-miller2024][^kolobaric2024]
For sedation and analgesia, cannabinol can be used **daily** (seemingly there is no tolerance).
There is little cross-tolerance with THC.

It's probably safer than hypnotics?[^kripke2012]

## Flavors

The subjective experience is sedation, relaxation, pain relief, and reduced thinking. CBN-P offers a tranquil, stable anchor of activation. It grabs and holds the attention. CBN or CBN-O offer a faint fizzy cloud of activation. They do not the grab the attention firmly. CBN-O is more 2-3 times more potent than CBN.

There is a dose threshold phenomenon. Once you reach the threshold dose of maximum intensity, additional substance only extends the duration rather than intensifying effects. The compound's effects persist into waking only when doses exceed certain thresholds.

| Which | Full Intensity | Persists Past Waking |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------  |
| CBN | 150mg | 0.5-1g |
| CBN-O | 50mg | 125-200mg |
| CBN-P | 4mg | 8mg |

If you expect stubborn insomnia, take double your usual dose 3-4 hours earlier than you would otherwise.

## In Blends

Counterintuitively, when paired with THC, CBN and CBN-O are 1:1 interchangable with indistinguishable phenomenology.
The difference in potency only applies when CBN/CBN-O is used *without* THC.

## Intensifying the Effect

The effect of CBN-P can be attenuated by a big dinner. That's where [kanna]({{< relref "kanna" >}}) can help. Kanna and CBN-P can work synergistically. A good analogy is archery. CBN-P aims and kanna releases the arrow.

Administer kanna 1-3 hours after taking CBN-P. Kanna isn't as potent as THC or psilocybin, but the big advantage is that it lacks a tolerance effect for daily use.

Dose kanna cautiously! If you take too much, even a relaxing, low mesembrine blend is going to feel uncomfortably stimulating. ðŸ¤¦
