# Cannabis

## Introduction

[Cannabinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid), a fascinating family of substances found in cannabis, remain shrouded in mystery despite their growing popularity. While over 100 cannabinoids have been identified, our understanding of these compounds is surprisingly limited. The scarcity of peer-reviewed research has left a significant gap in scientific knowledge, with many individual cannabinoids yet to be fully characterized and potential synergistic effects largely unexplored.[^entourage]

In light of this knowledge deficit, personal exploration becomes a valuable, albeit limited, source of insight. Here I present my evolving ideas about cannabinoids, primarily based on self-experimentation and a critical analysis of available scientific literature, anecdotal reports, and expert opinions. By combining these sources, I aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cannabinoids while acknowledging the shortcomings of this approach.

Medicinal use of cannabis dates back at least 5,000 years.
Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive in cannabis.
Commonly reported effects of THC include relaxation, euphoria, increased appetite, pain reduction, drowsiness, and occasionally, anxiety.
CBD (cannabidiol) is another widely known cannabinoid.
It is non-psychoactive and widely studied for its potential therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties.

### Terpenes

Terpenes are aromatic compounds that give different cannabis strains their unique scents and flavors. Found in many plants, cannabis contains over 100 different terpenes. These compounds may work synergistically with cannabinoids in what's called the *entourage effect*. Common terpenes include myrcene, limonene, and pinene.

I know nothing about terpenes.

## Routes of administration

Inhalation is probably the most widely known route of administration because it is so conspicuous.

- Inhalation (Smoking or Vaporizing): 
  - Pros: Rapid onset of effects (usually within minutes)
  - **Cons**: Respiratory irritation (especially with smoking), short duration of effects, imprecise dosing, must avoid acetate forms[^acetates]
- **Oral Ingestion** (Edibles, Oils, Capsules):
  - **Pros**: Longer-lasting effects (4-8 hours typically), no respiratory risks, discreet consumption, precise dosing
  - Cons: Slow onset (30 minutes to 2 hours)
- Sublingual (Tinctures, Sprays):
  - Pros: Relatively fast onset (15-45 minutes), bypasses first-pass liver metabolism
  - **Cons**: Hard to segregate from oral ingestion
- Topical (Creams, Balms) or Transdermal (Patches): This is **not comparable** because the effect is localized and non-intoxicating.

### Why prefer a longer duration?

The extended duration aligns well with those seeking a more profound, intimate experience, allowing for deeper introspection or prolonged relaxation.
This lengthier effect discourages casual or frequent use, potentially promoting a more mindful and respectful relationship with the substance.
However, the delayed onset of ingested cannabis makes accurate dosing crucial, as miscalculations can lead to uncomfortable experiences lasting several hours.
Users must carefully consider their dose and timing, as the extended duration can become problematic if unexpected obligations arise.

## The THC:CBD Ratio

THC is often taken in concert with CBD.
When I talk about THC, I implicitly mean both THC and CBD at 1:1 ratio.
However, the intensity of the experience is mostly a function of the amount of THC.
I'm not sure exactly how much CBD is required to complement the THC.
You definitely want enough CBD and extra isn't a problem.
Unless you are already an expert user:

{{% hint danger %}}
Do not take THC without CBD.
The combination of THC and CBD feels completely different than either molecule ingested alone.[^klein2011]
{{% /hint %}}

I am skeptical about the following infographic, but I tentatively agree that a ratio of 1:1 is a good place to start.
The same ratio applies for both Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC.

## New cannabinoids

Cannabis plants were traditionally categorized into two main types: sativa and indica, each known for distinct effects:

- Sativa
  - Energizing, uplifting effects
  - Often described as producing a "head high"
  - Believed to enhance creativity and focus
- Indica
  - Relaxing, sedating effects
  - Often described as producing a "body high"
  - Believed to aid sleep and reduce anxiety

However, the botanical validity of this simple dichotomy has been eroded by two significant trends:

- Decades of selective breeding have resulted in a diverse array of cannabis varieties, each with unique characteristics. Connoisseurs now recognize and appreciate a much wider spectrum of cannabis experiences beyond the traditional sativa-indica divide.
- Creative chemists have worked to isolate and synthesize individual cannabinoids. This has expanded the catalog of available substances, moving beyond what can be produced solely through plant cultivation.

As a result, the cannabis landscape has shifted.
The insatiable demand for novel cannabinoid blends no longer relies exclusively on careful plant cultivation.
Instead, isolated cannabinoids can be mixed in precise proportions to produce desired effects, offering a level of customization previously unattainable through traditional growing methods.
Since 1986, cannabinoids were hindered by legal ambiguity.[^rubin2023]
After the 2018 Farm Bill, many interesting cannabinoids became legal.

Cannabinoids can be organized into two categories: THC-like and CBD-like.
In general, the experience of one or more THC-like substances are improved by pairing with one or more CBD-like substances. However, some single cannabinoids are great in isolation.

### Euphoriants (THC-like)

- THC (Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC) offers a relaxing high.
- Δ10-THC (actually 70% Δ10-THC, 22% Δ8-THC) offers an energizing head high. Compatible: THCV, CBG, CBT, CBC, CDBV. CDBV is not bad, but I prefer the softness of CBC or CBT. Incompatible: CBN, CBD, H4CBD.
- HHC (hexahydrocannabinol) feels similar to Δ8-THC, but distributed unevenly across the body. Most of the effect is from the neck up, with some sensation from the waist up. The high is roughly balanced between energizing and relaxing. Weird.[^turkey-hhc] 👎

My tentative take is that there are not that many real choices for euphoriants.
There are substances with different potency and duration, but most of the variety in subjective effect is obtained through pairing with potentiators.

#### Closest Cousins: Δ8-THC vs Δ9-THC

{{% columns %}}

[![Delta9](delta9thc.webp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol)
{.center}
{{% /columns %}}

The main difference is that Δ8-THC is emotionally soothing while Δ9-THC is emotionally potentiating.
I might even draw the analogy that Δ8-THC is to psilomethoxin as Δ9-THC is to psilocybin.
If you haven't tried THC, start with Δ8-THC before trying Δ9-THC.

For occasional use, tolerance half-life seems to be about two days.
There is likely cross-tolerance because both substances are [CB1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_1) agonists.

#### What happens if you combine energizing and relaxing cannabinoids?

{{% details "Do you get one or the other or both?" %}}
{{% hint info %}}
Energy dominates.

Also, tolerance can be different for different components of a blend. So energy blends can feel especially weird if you don't wait long enough for the tolerance to wear off.

### Potentiators (CBD-like)

- CBD is the classic potentiator. CBD opens the emotional spigot around the heart.
- [H4CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H4-CBD) (hydrogenated CBD) offers the reassurance of CBD, but in an even more delightfully exquisite way. CBD is largely obsolete. However, consider that H4CBD has a longer duration than CBD which might be good or bad depending on your application. H4CBD causes the muchies mostly when it is wearing off during which it feels like regular CBD.
- CBN (cannabinol) offers a relaxing head high. Does not cause the munchies.
- CBG (cannabigerol) taken alone, I don't notice any effect from it. Maybe that's because I'm typically in a work mindset so CBG just feels like how I already feel.
- CBC (cannabichromene) holds the heart steady in a propeller shape. The propeller is about two inches long and near the sternum. Hilariously beautiful, but not better than CBDV or CBT.[^turkey-cbc]
- CBDV (cannabidivarin) holds the heart steady in a neutral shape while allowing a head high. A bit stimulating, but not incompatible with relaxation. Does not cause the munchies.
- CBT (cannabicitran) holds the heart steady in a hollow shape while allowing a relaxing head high. Does not cause the munchies. Possibly more potentiating and gentler come-down than CBDV.[^turkey-cbt]
- THCV (tetrahydrocannabivarin) simulating head high. Just a touch of scatterbrain. More alert than CBG. Maybe too alert. Harsh alertness? (Despite starting with the letter T, this is a potentiator because it doesn't do much without a euphoriant.)

#### Head-Heart Axis

CBN (head) and CBD (heart) are at opposite ends of the relaxing head-heart axis.
If you combine them 50/50 then they mostly cancel out and you get a remarkably ordinary sensation.

| Δ10-THC:CBG 1:1 | Super clear-headed stimulating head-high. Just a touch scatterbrained. 🤙🏼 |
| Δ8-THC:H4CBD 1:2 | Less spacious compared to 1:1 ratio. Sleepy. Feels fairly sober when walking around, but easy to get absorbed in meditation. Remarkably similar to 0.5g-1g psilomethoxin. 🤔 |
| Δ8-THC:CBN-O 38:62 | Beautiful relaxing, sparkling head-high. Not conducive to sleep. A bit prone to anxiety. 🤔 |
| HHC:CBN-O 1:2 | Not as relaxing, light, and sparkly as Δ8-THC:CBN-O. Not a headache, but some tension in the head and chest. Not great for sleep. 👎🏼 |
| Δ10-THC:CBN 1:1 | Not as shit as HHC:CBN-O, but nothing special. 👎🏼 |
| Δ8-THC:CBN-O 25:30 | Beautiful relaxing head-high. Works even if CBN was used on the prior evening. CBN is sensitive to time-of-day effects (night good, day bad). 🤔 |
| Δ8-THC:H4CBD 1:1 | Beautiful meditative experience. However, there is a duration mismatch as the H4CBD lasts too long. 🤔 |
| Δ8-THC:CBT:CBN-O 25:16.6:5 | Very beautiful. Probably would be better with ratio tilted toward CBN. 🤔 |

## Cannabinol (CBN) / Acetylated cannabinol (CBN-O)

[![CBN](cannabinol.webp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol)

CBN (without other cannabinoids) is recommmended for sleep.[^bonn-miller2024][^kolobaric2024]
For sedation and analgesia, CBN can be used daily (seemingly there is no tolerance).
For this type of use, CBN does not cause the munchies.
CBN-O is 2-3 times as potent as CBN, but they are otherwise very similar.

CBN used alone has little cross-tolerance with THC.

### Troubleshooting

CBN isn't a panacea.
If you are in heart-space then the CBN effect is too weak.
To really enjoy CBN, you need to get to head-space and out of heart-space.
Kanna is a promising solution.
Co-administer kanna and CBN.
Kanna peaks in an hour, just when CBN is coming online.

## Storage

Store acetylated cannabinoids in the refridgerator.
Other cannabinoids will probably be happier in the refridgerator too.

## Hepatotoxicity

- CBD: Less than 300 mg/day is safe.[^lo2023]
