## Subjective Map

### The Coordinate System
- **X-axis**: Represents the CBD:CBN ratio, ranging from pure CBD (-1) to pure CBN (+1), with exactly equal amounts at x=0.
- **Y-axis**: Represents THC concentration, with the center point (0,0) indicating baseline ratios (4:1:1 for Δ8-THC or 1:1:1 for Δ9-THC).
  - Positive y-values = higher THC concentration
  - Negative y-values = lower THC concentration

### Necessary Precision
The sine wave pattern reflects the challenging oscillation effects when CBD:CBN ratios aren't precisely balanced.[^formula] For a pleasant, smooth experience:
- Avoid unequal ratios like 49/51 as these can cause uncomfortable oscillation.
- Even 49.5/50.5 lacks sufficient precision.
- Aim for a CBN:CBD ratio within 0.5±0.25%. For a 1g mixture of each, the absolute weight difference should be \|CBN-CBD\| < 5mg.

### Recipe Correction
- At perfect 50/50 balance (x=0), the CBD and CBN effects largely cancel out. This feels remarkably ordinary.
- If you notice excessive hunger, add more CBN.
- If you notice divinity that is too exciting and lacks sufficient relaxation, add more CBD.
- If experiencing excessive stimulation/buzzing: add equal amounts of CBD and CBN.
- If experiencing flatness/insufficient effects: add THC.
