By default, the head is closed, and the heart is slightly open.
If you take THC without potentiators, then euphoria is mostly bottled up but will leak out uncomfortably.
You can take a heart potentiator without doing anything for the head (e.g., only H4CBD).
If you take a head potentiator without doing anything for the heart, then discomfort will accumulate in the heart.
There is a head/heart balance and a heart open/closed balance.
For example, if you take equal amounts of CBN (head) and CBD (heart), then the effects mostly cancel out.
Similarly, if you take equal amounts of H4CBD (open) and CBDV (closed), then the heart will be somewhat open.
Avoid stimulation in the head paired with relaxation in the heart.
That's the worst combination (e.g., THCV + H4CBD).
As the heart recovers to normal, there is a band of discomfort.
The band on the open side is much wider than the band on the closed side.
