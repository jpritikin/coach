# Cannabinoid Potentiator Map

## Introduction

Tragically, hardly anybody (i.e., not you) theorize about how different cannabinoids affect subjective experience.
Of course, you can only describe your personal feelings, and individual reactions often vary or even contradict one another.
Maybe the barrier is translating these experiences into clear language?
You shouldn't shy away from vivid metaphors.
Your unique perspective, however difficult to convey, enriches our understanding.
Speak up!
Share your journey through the haze of altered consciousness.
Every account adds a brushstroke to our collective canvas of cannabis comprehension.

If you take THC without potentiators, then euphoria is mostly bottled up but will leak out uncomfortably.
There is a head/heart balance and a heart open/closed balance.
Avoid stimulation in the head paired with inadequate relaxation in the heart.
That's the worst combination (e.g., THCV:CBD with ratio 3:2).
As the heart recovers to normal, there is a band of discomfort.
The band on the open side is much wider than the band on the closed side.
