# Cannabinoid Potentiator Map

## Introduction

Tragically, hardly anybody (i.e., not you) theorize about how different cannabinoids affect subjective experience.
Of course, you can only describe your personal feelings, and individual reactions often vary or even contradict one another.
Maybe the barrier is translating these experiences into clear language?
You shouldn't shy away from vivid metaphors.
Your unique perspective, however difficult to convey, enriches our understanding.

Every account adds a brushstroke to our collective canvas of cannabis comprehension.

By default, the head is closed, and the heart is slightly open.
If you take THC without potentiators, then euphoria is mostly bottled up but will leak out uncomfortably.
You can take a heart potentiator without doing anything for the head (e.g., only H4CBD).
If you take a head potentiator without doing anything for the heart, then discomfort will accumulate in the heart.
There is a head/heart balance and a heart open/closed balance.
For example, if you take equal amounts of CBN (head) and CBD (heart), then the effects mostly cancel out.
Similarly, if you take equal amounts of H4CBD (open) and CBDV (closed), then the heart will be somewhat open.
Avoid stimulation in the head paired with inadequate relaxation in the heart.
That's the worst combination (e.g., THCV:CBD with ratio 3:2).
As the heart recovers to normal, there is a band of discomfort.
The band on the open side is much wider than the band on the closed side.
