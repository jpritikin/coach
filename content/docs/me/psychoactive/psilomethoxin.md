# Psilomethoxin

Psilomethoxin (Pm) offers soothing comfort similar to MDMA, but without MDMA’s stimulant-like effects.[^pm-subjective] Pm might be an incredibly important discovery because it might be the ideal complement to psychotherapy.[^beres2019]

## Contraindications

Since psilomethoxin is similar to 5-MeO-DMT, it is prudent to regard
contraindications for 5-MeO-DMT as contraindications for psilomethoxin
until we have more data.

- Allergy to Psilocybe mushrooms[^mushroom]
- Epilepsy (a strong contraindication for 5-MeO-DMT)
- 5-MeO-DMT interacts with CYP2D6 and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
  - CYP2D6 inhibitors such as Paroxetine, Bupropion, Quinidine, etc
  - MAO inhibitors such as beta carbolines, harmala alkaloids, moclobemide, etc
- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
- Lithium
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding

## Notes

[^pm-subjective]: [Effects of Psilomethoxin from Experienced 5-MeO-DMT Practitioner](https://psilomethoxin.com/effects-of-psilomethoxin-from-experienced-5-meo-dmt-practitioner/)

[^mushroom]: If you sourced psilomethoxin from the [Church of Sacred Synthesis](https://psilomethoxin.com/?sld=jpritikin) then you received sacrament in the form of dried Psilocybe mushroom powder.
Although many mushrooms of the Psilocybe genus produce psilocybin and psilocin, the manufacturing process devised by the church ensures that psilomethoxin is produced with only trace amounts of psilocybin or psilocin.
