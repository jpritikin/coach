# Psilomethoxin

## Introduction

Psilomethoxin (Pm) offers soothing comfort similar to MDMA, but without MDMA’s stimulant-like effects.[^pm-subjective] Pm might be an incredibly important discovery because it might be the ideal complement to psychotherapy.[^beres2019]

## Contraindications

Since psilomethoxin is similar to 5-MeO-DMT, it is prudent to regard
contraindications for 5-MeO-DMT as contraindications for psilomethoxin
until we have more data.

- Allergy to Psilocybe mushrooms[^mushroom]
- Epilepsy (a strong contraindication for 5-MeO-DMT)
- 5-MeO-DMT interacts with CYP2D6 and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
  - CYP2D6 inhibitors such as Paroxetine, Bupropion, Quinidine, etc
  - MAO inhibitors such as beta carbolines, harmala alkaloids, moclobemide, etc
- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
- Lithium
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding

## Suggestions for Initial Use

There can be a lot of anxiety associated with the first use of a substance.
The goal of this brief guide is to help you enjoy Pm, for the first time, with the least amount of risk.
Since Pm blunts anxiety, it is particularly important not to put yourself in a situation that stokes anxiety.

### Storage

If you have dried Psilocybe mushroom powder, store it at room temperature in a dark place.
Storage in a refrigerator or freezer is not recommended because low temperatures can cause water to condense and the water can cause degradation.

### Cooking

Pm is sensitive to heat.
This is thought to be one reason why Pm has not yet yielded to scientific analysis.
To mix the powder with chocolate, use the lowest possible temperature.

### Dosage

Start with a low-to-medium [psycholytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy#Psycholytic_therapy) dose.
In this dose range, there is practically no visual or cognitive distortion.
The most obvious subjective effects are that multitasking becomes more difficult and you can no longer feel anxiety or boredom.

To make the discussion less cumbersome, refer to the following abbreviations:

| abbreviation | experience with Pm | experience with traditional psychedelics |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------|
| naïve | no | no |
| trad savvy | no | yes |
| friend | no | - |
| pm savvy | yes | - |

A journey can benefit from a **pm savvy** guide because Pm is amenable to [emotional contagion and coherence]({{< relref "/posts/psychedelic-use-by-facilitators" >}}).
For this reason, a **pm savvy** guide should use the same or similar dose as the **friend** companion.
A sober trip sitter is of little benefit.
If a **pm savvy** guide is not available then a group of two or more **naïve** persons can work together to stabilize the emotional coherence.

| amount | remark |
| ------ | ------ |
| 150mg, 300mg  | Start here if you're **trad savvy** and alone with no companion. This is also a good place for a **naïve** person to start with a **pm savvy** guide. At 150mg, you may feel some energy circulation but probably not the true flavor of Pm. At the peak of 300mg, you will likely get a taste of Pm's true flavor. |
| 450mg  | A strong first journey is an option if there is a close relationship between the **naïve** friend and **pm savvy** guide. Regardless of your **friend**'s experience, at this dose, I recommend a **pm savvy** guide. |
| 600mg, 800mg  | A confident **pm savvy** guide could consider this dose for an adventurous **trad savvy** friend. For perspective, I would hesitate to use more than 600mg while driving a car. |

Amounts are in mg of dried Psilocybe mushroom powder.

### Timing

Consume Pm at breakfast or lunchtime. The effects of Pm are best appreciated in the daytime because of the contrast to typical daytime mood. At night, there is already a natural tendency to feel somewhat similar to the effects of Pm, making the contrast less vivid.

### Food?

In contrast to alcohol, the effects of Pm seem mostly unaffected by recently eaten food.
If you take Pm in a capsule, chew the capsule before swallowing;
there have been reports of 1-2 hour delays possibly caused by consuming intact capsules on an empty stomach.
Taking a little food with Pm seems to speed absorption.
If you struggle with nausea then you may prefer to eat less food or use an antiemetic.[^nausea]
I suspect any nausea is mostly associated with anxiety. So you may feel more nausea during the initial journey but no nausea from larger doses, once you get comfortable with Pm.

### Administration

Once you decide on a dose, take the whole dose at once, or maybe within 5-10 minutes, if you want to try a tiny bit and then finish the rest.
Don't use Pm more than once per day;
to get familiar with the substance, you want to feel the subjective effects from the peak all the way through the afterglow and back to baseline.
The mild lingering afterglow can last for 3-12 hours.[^pharmacodynamics]

### Set & Setting

The effects of Pm can be surprisingly subtle.
You could take a larger dose for more dramatic effects, but it is safer to be as receptive as possible with a lower dose.
Select a boring environment.
If there is too much entertainment or stimulation, [it is easy to miss the subjective effects]({{< relref "/posts/psilomethoxin-case-report-addendum1.md" >}}).
You might go for a walk in the park during the first hour of the journey, but after that, you should sit down somewhere isolated.
Find an environment where you can test whether you can still feel boredom.
If you are a restless impatient person, this is actually an advantage because it will be easier to notice when you cannot feel boredom.

[^pm-subjective]: [Effects of Psilomethoxin from Experienced 5-MeO-DMT Practitioner](https://psilomethoxin.com/effects-of-psilomethoxin-from-experienced-5-meo-dmt-practitioner/)

[^mushroom]: If you sourced psilomethoxin from the [Church of Sacred Synthesis](https://psilomethoxin.com/?sld=jpritikin) then you received sacrament in the form of dried Psilocybe mushroom powder.
Although many mushrooms of the Psilocybe genus produce psilocybin and psilocin, the manufacturing process devised by the church ensures that psilomethoxin is produced with only trace amounts of psilocybin or psilocin.
