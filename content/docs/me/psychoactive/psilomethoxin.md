# Psilomethoxin

Psilomethoxin (Pm) offers soothing comfort similar to MDMA, but without MDMAâ€™s stimulant-like effects.[^pm-subjective]

For more information, read [my case report]({{< relref "psilomethoxin-case-report" >}}).

## Contraindications

Since psilomethoxin is similar to 5-MeO-DMT, it is prudent to regard
contraindications for 5-MeO-DMT as contraindications for psilomethoxin
until we have more data.

- Allergy to Psilocybe mushrooms[^mushroom]
- Epilepsy (a strong contraindication for 5-MeO-DMT)
- 5-MeO-DMT interacts with CYP2D6 and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
  - CYP2D6 inhibitors such as Paroxetine, Bupropion, Quinidine, etc
  - MAO inhibitors such as beta carbolines, harmala alkaloids, moclobemide, etc
- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
- Lithium
