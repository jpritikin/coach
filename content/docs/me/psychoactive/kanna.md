# Kanna

Kanna contains many alkaloids including mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, mesembranol, epimesembranol, and tortuosamine. Of these, mesembrine and mesembrenone are thought to be the main contributors to the psychoactive effects:

|  | mesembrine | mesembrenone |
|--|------------|--------------|
| molecule | [![mesembrine](mesembrine.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesembrine) | [![mesembrenone](mesembrenone2DACS.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesembrenone) |
| subjective effect | energy/focus | calming/relaxation |

In 2012, the first commercial kanna extract, *Zembrin*, was made available in North America.[^zembrin] Zembrin is optimized for relaxation (i.e., less than 20% mesembrine) and is typically sold in 25mg tablets. Zembrin only contains 0.35–0.45% total alkaloids.[^murbach2014]
Other vendors sell much more potent extracts. You can find products with more than 5% total alkaloids (i.e., ≈10x more concentrated than Zembrin). I use an extract optimized for relaxation. As long as mesembrine is less than 50% of the total alkaloids, the subjective effect is going to be pretty relaxing.
