# How to Untie the Knot of the Ego

## Ego

The *ego* can be regarded as your personal constellation of parts.
Some people regard the ego as an enemy or obstacle to growth.
However, in [IFS]({{< relref "IFS" >}}), we learn that there are no bad parts; all
parts have good intentions for us. We need an ego, it is just that it
should not dominate our life and tie us in knots; we need to be Self led.

## How to meditate

Instructions are often of the form:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra or visual target or whatever).
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target.
3. Loop back to step 1.

We can translate these instructions into IFS terms. Step 1 represents a managerial
Focuser part whose job it is to keep attention on a target. Step 2
represents a managerial Bouncer part whose job it is to tell all the other parts to
keep quiet, except for the Focuser part.
If any part fails to cooperate, the Bouncer part is
called upon to deal with it. There are at least
two possible outcomes:

- Parts will be constantly popping in and out. There will not be
much of a chance for the Self to radiate. Inexperienced
meditators may encounter this *monkey mind* situation and give up, not knowing
how to progress further.
- Will power can be deployed into the managerial parts.
These managerial parts can, with effort, force other parts into submission.
This indeed makes some space for the Self to shine.
However, this situation is a *spiritual bypass* because the
knots of parts are submerged, not untied. This is an unstable truce.

What is often not appreciated is that the typical instructions for
*How to meditate* are like training wheels. After a little practice,
the method itself becomes a hindrance to meditation because it
requires too much effort. To really enjoy the Self in a profound way, all the
parts must willing cede the stage to the Self, including the Focuser
and Bouncer parts. In a paradoxical twist, the Self can shine as brightly
as the meditation is effortless.

## Easing into effortlessness

Here is what should happen. Ask all the parts to
quiet down for a duration. Parts, being obedient, cooperate.
No muscular Bouncer or Focuser parts are needed.
Sounds great, but how does anybody develop such a mature practice?
We refer back to the original instructions, with an additional
step:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra or visual target or whatever).
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target.
3. **Note down which parts want attention and why.**
4. Loop back to Step 1.

This is not a meditation practice, per se; this is an inner excavation
practice. You are looking for parts that need attention. What the
the original instructions bury is actually valuable information.
The output
of this process, the list of parts and their concerns,
you can bring to your [IFS Practitioner]({{< relref "IFS" >}}).
Get curious about these parts. Ask the usual questions. What is your
job? Do you protect other parts? What are you afraid would happen
if you didn't do you job? Etc. These parts refused to be quiet because
they need your care and attention. As you scrub your inner system clean,
bathing each part in calm understanding,
your Self will appear with more and more effortlessness and spontaneity.
