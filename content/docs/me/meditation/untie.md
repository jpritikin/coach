# A matter of method

## How to meditate

Instructions are often of the form:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra or visual target or whatever).
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target.
3. Loop back to step 1.

We can translate these instructions into IFS terms. Step 1 represents a managerial
Focuser part whose job it is to keep attention on a target. Step 2
represents a managerial Bouncer part whose job it is to tell all the other parts to
keep quiet, except for the Focuser part.
If any part fails to cooperate, the Bouncer part is
called upon to deal with it. There are at least
two possible outcomes:

- Parts will be constantly popping in and out. There will not be
much of a chance for the Self to radiate. Inexperienced
meditators may encounter this *monkey mind* situation and give up, not knowing
how to progress further.
- Will power can be deployed into the managerial parts.
These managerial parts can, with effort, force other parts into submission.
This indeed makes some space for the Self to shine.
However, this situation is a *spiritual bypass* because the
parts are suppressed. This is an unstable truce.

What is often not appreciated is that the typical instructions for
*How to meditate* are like training wheels. After a little practice,
the method itself becomes a hindrance to meditation because it
requires too much effort. To really enjoy the Self in a profound way, all the
parts must willing cede the stage to the Self, including the Focuser
and Bouncer parts. In a paradoxical twist, the Self can shine as brightly
as the meditation is effortless.

## Easing into effortlessness

Here is what should happen:
{{< hint info >}}
Ask all the parts to quiet down for a duration.  
Parts, being obedient, cooperate.  
No muscular Bouncer or Focuser parts are needed.
{{< /hint >}}
Sounds great, but how does anybody develop such a mature practice?
I suggest that we take the original instructions and add an additional
step:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra or visual target or whatever).
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target.
3. **Note down which parts want attention and why.**
4. Loop back to Step 1.

This is not a meditation practice, per se; this is an inner excavation
practice. You are looking for parts that need attention. What the
the original instructions bury is actually valuable information.
The output
of this process, the list of parts and their concerns,
you can bring to your [IFS Practitioner]({{< relref "IFS" >}}).
Get curious about these parts. Ask the usual questions. What is your
job? Do you protect other parts? What are you afraid would happen
if you didn't do you job? Etc. These parts refused to be quiet because
they need your care and attention. As you scrub your inner system clean,
bathing each part in calm understanding,
your Self will appear with more and more effortlessness and spontaneity.

## Object of attention

When the Bouncer and Focuser parts are overactive, the particular
choice of target for the Focuser is of little consequence. With parts
frequently bubbling to the surface, the Self can barely connect with
the outside world. Therapists who work with traumatized clients see
this all the time; these clients barely have any access to Self. As
the parts quiet down and meditation becomes effortless, the choice of
what to focus on, the object of attention, becomes an important
consideration.  Self energy is available to blend with the object of
attention in a fully engrosing, enveloping, and entrancing way.

### A comment on psychedelics

By *psychedelic*, I mean any substance that amplifies your inner experience
such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) or
dimethyltryptamine (colloquially known as Daime or Ayahuasca).
The effect of a psychedelic strongly depends on the willingness of your
parts to get quiet. There are at least three possible outcomes:
- Parts are overactive and not willing to get quiet. A psychedelic
will tend to make them more loud and extreme. This is going to be a difficult trip.
This corresponds to the monkey mind of an inexperienced meditator,
magnified to Godzilla size.
- Parts are active but willing to get quiet. In this situation,
the client gains more access to Self energy and may do parts work
spontaneously.[^mdma] There is the opportunity to make rapid strides
toward theraputic goals.
- Parts are fairly quiet. The Self shines with unusual brilliance
because the psychedelic does the Bouncer's job,
facilitating an experience of Self that is profoundly effortless.
Similar to effortless meditation, there is ample capacity for blending
with the object of attention. This is readily seen in reports
of music perception under the influence of psychedelics. For example,
"Volunteers reported far greater
absorption in music, as well as greater perceived
beauty and significance of music."[^barrett2018]

### Some suggested targets

I have collected a variety of interesting targets to blend with.
In addition to any immediate sensation,
an engrosing blending episode can create an affective
afterglow that can last for hours. Before I list some suggestions, I
want to emphasize that these experiences are most available
starting from effortless meditation. Without effortless meditation,
you might as well use a target like maintaining awareness of breathing
as you work toward effortlessness. Your experience will mostly
be cluttered with the Focuser and Bouncer parts, and other parts
in need of attention and care. So do not worry about picking a
special target until you have progressed in effortlessness.

The following list is suitable for effortless meditation.
I have limited experience with picking targets to combine with
psychedelics. Certainly music can inspire beautiful emotion with either
effortless meditation or psychedelics, but it is not clear whether all
targets suited to effortless meditation work in a similar way when
used with psychedelics. In suggesting targets to attend to, I acknowledge
that a Focuser part is necessarily present. Effortlessness
is an ideal that can only be approximated; a reasonable approximation
will suffice.

| Target | Focusing Vigilance | Immediate Sensation | Afterglow |
|--------|------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| [slow exhales]({{< relref "breathing" >}}) | Medium | calming | - |
| [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses" >}}) | High | - | increase afterglow duration in combination with other targets |
| [foot soaking]({{< relref "foot-soak" >}}) | Low | relaxing | reduction in tension |
| [cold exposure]({{< relref "cold-exposure" >}}) | Low | cold | reduction in tension |
| [ice on liver]({{< relref "liver" >}}) | Low | calming | reduces residual mental activity |
| [sahasrara]({{< relref "sahasrara" >}}) | High | freeing | resets mood back to normal |
