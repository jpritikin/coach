# A matter of method

## Preamble

Parts of this article were [published](https://partsandself.org/ifs-and-meditation/)
by the PARTS & SELF magazine.
You will need to be familiar with [IFS terminology]({{< relref "IFS" >}}) to appreciate this article.

I believe one use of meditation is to facilitate unblending.
I will focus on this use. I will need to be specific about the degree of blending in a given moment. For example, a Self to Parts proportion of 99:1 is almost all Self and no Parts (unblended) whereas a proportion of 1:99 is all Parts and almost no Self (blended). To calibrate our measure, suppose a mentally well person has a 1:1 proportion with roughly equal contributions from Self and Parts. In comparison, during a psychotherapy session, IFS practitioners might sustain a 6:4 or 7:3 proportion of unblending, being somewhat more in Self energy than in Parts.

This idea of a ratio will be important to bear in mind as we consider now how to meditate, using an approach that includes the idea of unblending.

## How to meditate

Instructions are often of the form:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra, or visual target, or whatever)
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target
3. Loop back to step 1

We can translate these instructions into IFS terms. Step 1 represents a managerial
focuser Part whose job it is to keep attention on a non-Part target. Step 2
represents a managerial bouncer Part whose job it is to tell all the other Parts to
keep quiet, except for the focuser Part.
If any Part fails to cooperate, the bouncer Part is
called upon to deal with it. There are at least
two possible outcomes:

- Parts will be constantly popping in and out. There will not be
much of a chance for the Self to radiate. Inexperienced
meditators may encounter this *monkey mind* situation and give up, not knowing
how to progress further.
- Will power can be deployed into the managerial Parts.
These managerial Parts can, with effort, force other Parts into submission.
This indeed makes some space for the Self to shine.
However, this situation is a *spiritual bypass* because the
Parts are suppressed. This is an unstable truce.

What is often not appreciated is that the typical instructions for
*How to Meditate* are like training wheels. After a little practice,
the method itself becomes a hindrance to meditation because it
requires too much effort. In the best case, a person with 2:3 Self to Parts
ratio might reach 6:4, but the method itself puts a limit on the degree of unblending.
To really enjoy the Self in a profound way, all the
Parts must willingly cede the stage to the Self, including the focuser
and bouncer Parts. In a paradoxical twist, the Self shines brightly
in direct relation to the effortlessness involved in the meditating:
the less effort utilised, the more Self shines. In this way we can see that Parts unblending by ceding the stage to the Self must be done with full consent on their part; without fight, fear or dismissal, but instead with natural ease.

## Easing into effortlessness

Here is what should happen in a truly effortless meditation:
{{< hint info >}}
Ask all the Parts to quiet down for a duration  
Parts, being obedient, cooperate  
No muscular bouncer or focuser Parts are needed
{{< /hint >}}
Sounds great, but how does anybody develop such a mature practice?
I suggest that we add an additional step to the original instructions:

1. Focus on your breath (or a mantra, or visual target, or whatever)
2. Notice when your mind has wandered from the target
3. **Note down which Parts want attention and why**
4. Loop back to step 1

This is not a meditation practice, per se; this is an inner excavation
practice. You are looking for Parts that need attention. What the
original instructions bury is actually valuable information.
The output
of this process is a list of Parts and their concerns.
You can bring this list to your [IFS Practitioner]({{< relref "IFS" >}})
or, if you don't have a Practitioner, work with the list gently on your own.
Get curious about these Parts. Ask the usual questions: What is your
job? Do you protect other Parts? What are you afraid would happen
if you didn't do your job?, etc. These Parts refused to be quiet because
they need your care and attention. As you scrub your inner system clean,
bathing each Part in calm understanding,
your Self will appear with more and more effortlessness and spontaneity.

We can suggest that paying these vocal Parts attention is a Self energized compassion for them.

## Targets

I have already used the word target above to denote non-Part sensory experiences that are a necessary focus (by a focuser Part) for attention, in order to practice meditation or inner excavation. This non-Part target is a crude Parts detector because if you are not aware of the target, then there is a Part coming in between. When the bouncer and focuser Parts are overactive, any affectively neutral target for the focuser Part will do. You need something to try and return to and issues to do with quality of target (as discussed below in brief) are not important. With Parts frequently bubbling to the surface, the Self can barely connect with targets; steady, stable focus is elusive. Therapists who work with distressed clients see this all the time; these clients barely have any access to Self. These troubled clients might be 1:19 or even more severely blended.

As the Parts quiet down and meditation becomes effortless (e.g., Self to Parts ratio of 7:3), the choice of target for the focuser Part becomes an important consideration. An affectively neutral target is appropriate for beginners because it reduces the number of variables. When both Parts and the target can provoke emotion then the meditation practice is that much more challenging because there is too much going on. However, once Parts are willing and able to get quiet then an affectively neutral target like a bare wall or a lit candle becomes boring. Instead, when you have achieved some inner quietness, why not blend with targets that have qualities associated with satisfaction, beauty, joy, relaxation, or connection? Faint impressions of these affective states, enriched by ample Self energy, can be experienced with lush vibrancy. Targets with an affective charge, such as found in those arts evoking emotions (e.g., music), can help locate these elusive feelings. For example, a target associated with slight or faint relaxation can be experienced in a fully engrossing, enveloping, and entrancing way. In addition to any immediate sensation, an engrossing blending episode with an affectively charged target can create an emotional and attitudinal afterglow that can last for hours.[^basso2019]

### Some suggested targets

I have collected a variety of affectively charged targets to blend with.
Before I list some suggestions, I
want to emphasize that these experiences are most available
starting from effortless meditation. Without effortless meditation,
you might as well use a target like maintaining awareness of breathing
as you work toward effortlessness. Your experience will mostly
be cluttered with the focuser and bouncer Parts, and other Parts
in need of attention and care. So do not worry about picking an
affectively charged target until you have progressed in effortlessness.

The following list is suitable for effortless meditation.
I have limited experience with picking targets to combine with
[psychedelics]({{< relref "psychoactive" >}}).
Certainly music can inspire beautiful emotion with either
effortless meditation or psychedelics, but it is not clear whether all
targets suited to effortless meditation work in a similar way when
used with psychedelics. In suggesting targets to attend to, I acknowledge
that a Focuser Part is necessarily present. Effortlessness
is an ideal that can only be approximated; a reasonable approximation
will suffice.

| Target | Focusing Vigilance | Immediate Sensation | Afterglow |
|--------|------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| [slow exhales]({{< relref "breathing" >}}) | Medium | calming | - |
| [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses" >}}) | Low | - | increase afterglow duration in combination with other targets |
| [foot soaking]({{< relref "foot-soak" >}}) | Low | relaxing | reduction in tension |
| [cold exposure]({{< relref "cold-exposure" >}}) | Medium | cold | reduction in tension |
| [ice on liver]({{< relref "liver" >}}) | Medium | calming | reduces mental activity |
| [sahasrara]({{< relref "sahasrara" >}}) | High | freeing | resets mood back to normal |
