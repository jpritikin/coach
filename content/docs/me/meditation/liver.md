# Ice on the liver

Don't overdo it. Keep an undershirt between the cold pack and your
body.

This is a gel pack; you can use regular ice too.
If you have normal anatomy, the liver is on the right side.

## Timing

Do not attempt this treatment on an empty stomach. Immediately
before sleeping works well.
