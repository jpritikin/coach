# Breathing ü´Å

## Prelude

For a long time, I was skeptical that mindful breathing would have any
special effect. I mean, we all breathe all the time; it's the most
ordinary thing. What could possibly be special about it?

## The Technique

To calm yourself, exhale for a longer duration than your inhalation.[^buteyko][^adhana2013]

When a dog is lying down and wants to relax then she will often start her rest with two quick breaths followed by a long, slow exhale. üêï

## Commentary

This technique should not be done like static apnea holds in
preparation for freediving ü§ø. As soon as you feel any hint of anxiety (i.e., air hunger),
do not hesitate to resume breathing. If you do not feel
continuously calm then you are not breathing enough. If you get behind
on breathing then feel free to take 1-5 quick deep breaths and then
return to the protocol.

Don't time the duration of inhales or exhales.
Watching the clock or counting seconds ‚è≤Ô∏è can distract from
the feeling of calm. It is obvious that a quick inhale is of shorter duration than a long
exhale; rough approximation of the relative durations is adequate
precision. Try to extend the length of time that you remain calm
as air hunger increases, but resume breathing immediately before the sense of calm
flips into anxiety.

As far as I am aware, this is the only meditation technique that works
mostly independently of the external environment.  You can practice
this during Monday morning rush hour on the New York City subway üöÜ (not
the most calm and soothing environment).

When not combined with other meditation techniques, the effect of this
technique is not long-lasting. Whatever calm you enjoy is typically
sustained only while focused on your breathing.
