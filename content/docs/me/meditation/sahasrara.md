# Sahasrara (chakra #7)

Sahasrara is the point of connection between the universal Self and
our personal Self.
The founder of [Sahaja Yoga Meditation](https://us.sahajayoga.org/)
claimed that she, "opened the sahasrara." Hence, one would expect some
technique for meditating on the sahasrara. Here is a mash-up of two
such techniques from Sahaja Yoga.

Although the primary location of the sahasrara is above the head, one
discovery from Sahaja Yoga is that the chakras are associated with
regions on the hands (see figure on right). This is fortunate since it
quickly becomes tiring to keep the right hand lifted above the
head. Switch back and forth between the saharsara areas on the head
and left hand whenever you feel fatigue.

How you attend to these maneuvers is of critical importance. 
Feel into the finger tips of your right hand and the current
sahasrara area.  Moreover, try to feel into the gap between these
two parts of your body.

To prevent your attention from wandering, randomly vary

- rotational velocity (slow, medium, and fast)
- radius of the circular motion
- distance between your right hand and the sahasrara area (1-6 cm)

If you are tracking accurately, how you feel should match how your right hand moves.

## Timing

Use to conclude a meditation session. Don't combine with other techniques.

Focusing with perfect discipline on the light in the crown of the
head, one acquires the perspective of the perfected ones.
