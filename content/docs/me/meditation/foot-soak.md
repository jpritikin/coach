# Foot soaking

{{% columns %}}

Place some warm water in a dishpan[^pan] with a handful of salt.[^salt]

Sit comfortably on a chair, put your feet in the salt water,
and meditate for 5-15 minutes.

Helps address [Restless Legs Syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/restless-legs-syndrome-fact-sheet) and improves sleep quality.[^haghayegh2019][^aghamohammadi2020][^sung2000]

Can combine with [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses"  >}}).
In fact, with lukewarm water, foot soak could be regarded as
withdrawing the feet from the touch and texture of being on a surface.

If your legs still feel restless, try [calf raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M4-G8p8fmc).

Use [cold exposure]({{< relref "cold-exposure"  >}}) instead if you need greater relief.

## Notes

[^pan]: A half-size steam table pan works great too.

[^salt]: Use table salt ðŸ§‚ (sodium chloride) to mimic ocean water. Epsom salt (magnesium
sulfate) is a great fertilizer for plants.
