# Foot soaking

{{% columns %}}

Place some warm water in a dishpan[^pan] with a handful of salt.[^salt]

Sit comfortably on a chair, put your feet in the salt water,
and meditate for 5-15 minutes.

This helps address [Restless Legs Syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/restless-legs-syndrome-fact-sheet).

Can combine with [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses"  >}}).
In fact, with luke warm water, foot soak could be regarded as
withdrawing the feet from the touch and texture of being on a surface.

Use [cold exposure]({{< relref "cold-exposure"  >}}) instead if you need greater relief.

## Notes

[^pan]: A half-size steam table pan works great too.

[^salt]: Use table salt ðŸ§‚ (sodium chloride) to mimic ocean water. Epsom salt (magnesium
sulfate) is a great fertilizer for plants.
