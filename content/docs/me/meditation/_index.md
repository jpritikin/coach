# Meditation

## What is meditation?

To try to answer this question, I have studied the contemplative
traditions of many of the world's major religions. For example,

- Christianity ‚úùÔ∏è
- Islam ‚ò™Ô∏è
- Hinduism üïâÔ∏è

<--->

- Buddhism (VajrayƒÅna, MahƒÅyƒÅna, & Zen)
- Daoism (Taoism) ‚òØÔ∏è
- Judaism üïé

I have also studied with a handful of contemporary meditation
teachers.[^lenz] What I learned is that there is not much consensus about the
precise definition of *meditation*. I prefer to define meditation in
IFS terms:

{{< hint info >}}
Meditation becomes possible when you are not identified with your
parts. Meditation occurs when some proportion of your being is
free to radiate Self energy.
{{< /hint >}}

In some traditions, there is a notion of *enlightenment* or
*liberation* that demarcates some stage of personal transformation.
However, we should not be satisfied with personal transformation of any degree;
The appropriate benchmark for attainment is global, societal transformation.
Everybody should have the opportunity to climb Maslow's pyramid.

## Meditation Techniques

Meditation is more like a dance than a desk lamp ü™î. There are moves to learn.
The techniques that I describe in sub-sections assume that you are already
proficient in meditation. Without a basic competence in
[effortless meditation]({{< relref "effortlessness" >}}),
you may not obtain any benefit from these techniques. Moreover, these
techniques may not work when under the influence of psychedelics.

### On breathing

Use an inspiratory muscle training device to improve your breathing mechanics.

The only meditation technique that I am familiar with is [here]({{< relref "breathing" >}}).

### On mantras, prayers, poetry, music

In a solo context, there is potential for spiritual bypass. A
mantra recited vigorously can pave over and hide unaddressed parts with
unaddressed issues that would otherwise be in dialog filling your head
with thoughts. Suppression is not a good long-term strategy.

In a group context, prayers and music can help synchronize individuals
and invite communitas.[^turner2012]

### Timing

The best time to practice meditation is 4:30 to 9:00 (am and pm) in your local time zone.

- Use 300-600mg per day. Capsaicin acts as a relaxing analgesic for [TRPV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1) in the colin.[^bortolotti2011]
- Serotonin is one of the main neurotransmitters involved in both meditation and psychedelics.[^serotonin2017] Serotonin receptors are widely expressed within the gastrointestinal tract.[^mawe2013] (This is suggestive of some kind of causal relationships.)
- You might take cayenne with morning tea.[^morr√©2003]
- Avoid cayenne pepper on an empty stomach üß®üî•.
