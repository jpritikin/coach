# Cold exposure

Do [foot soaking]({{< relref "foot-soak" >}}) but with ice-cold water.

Don't combine this with [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses" >}})
because you should use all of your attention to relax your
feet. Use ample ice because it's easier to relax when the water is at
lower a temperature.[^carney2020]

Effective for Restless Legs Syndrome.

If your legs still feel restless, try [calf raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M4-G8p8fmc).

One virtue of this method of cold exposure is that it doesn't depend
on the outside weather and requires little ice (1 quart is pictured).

You can combine this technique with [liver treatment]({{< relref "liver" >}}).
