# Withdrawal of the senses

## Patanjali section 2 verse 54:

{{% columns %}}

स्वविषयासम्प्रयोगे चित्तस्य स्वरूपानुकार इवेन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहाः

<--->

When consciousness interiorizes by
uncoupling from external objects, the senses do likewise; this is
called withdrawal of the senses.

## Example

For the visual mode, close your eyes but continue to observe what you
see. You should see a sparkling yellow/orange field of uncertain depth and
lacking any structure. Open your eyes slightly so that you can maintain
awareness of the neutral field superimposed over your regular visual
input. Change your identification: Instead of regarding your visual
input as real, the undifferentiated field is real and your regular
visual input happens to exist within the field.

I am most comfortable with the visual sense, but same method likely
works similarly with other senses. Experiment with a sensory
deprivation tank?

## Commentary

You can combine this technique with mindful [breathing]({{< relref
"breathing" >}}).  The two techniques are highly synergistic. The
momentary calm from mindful breathing makes it easier to withdraw from
the senses, and withdrawal of the senses helps sustain the feeling of
calm from mindful breathing.
