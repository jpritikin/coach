# Withdrawal of the senses

## Patanjali section 2 verse 54:

{{% columns %}}

स्वविषयासम्प्रयोगे चित्तस्य स्वरूपानुकार इवेन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहाः

<--->

When consciousness interiorizes by
uncoupling from external objects, the senses do likewise; this is
called withdrawal of the senses.

## Example

For the visual sense, close your eyes or wear a blindfold.[^effortless]

For the auditory sense, wear ear protection used by
operators of loud machinery.

Experiment with a sensory deprivation tank.

## Commentary

You can combine this technique with mindful [breathing]({{< relref
"breathing" >}}).  The two techniques are highly synergistic. The
momentary calm from mindful breathing makes it easier to withdraw from
the senses, and withdrawal of the senses helps sustain the feeling of
calm from mindful breathing.

## Notes

[^effortless]: A blindfold may be preferable because
keeping the eyes closed involves some effort. Ideally,
withdrawal of the senses should be completely effortless.
