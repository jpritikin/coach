# Single-Pot Anything-Goes Ramen

For when you want slurpy noodles but your pantry's a beautiful mess.

**The Foundation** (aka the non-negotiables):

- 2 cups water
- 1 teaspoon soup concentrate (the kind that makes 1 cup of soup)
- 100-120g pasta (yes, ANY pasta—spaghetti, sweet potato glass noodles, that random bag of rotini hiding in the back)
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- ½ teaspoon red pepper
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon turmeric (for that golden glow)
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds

**The Fun Stuff** (pick your adventure):

- 1 tablespoon peanuts (halves or butter—either way, nutty goodness)
- 1-2 tablespoons wakame (for ocean vibes)
- 1/2 cup Broccoli sprouts (tiny trees!)
- ½ teaspoon fresh ginger (extra zing)
- ½ cup TVP or ¼ cup lentils or 1/3 cup edamame (protein power-up)

**Cool-Down Crew** (literally):

Toss in frozen spinach or frozen corn at the end to stop your noodles from turning to mush while also chilling your bowl to eating temperature. It's science!

**Method:**

Dump everything in one pot. Boil. Simmer until noodles are done. Top with your frozen veggie of choice. Slurp triumphantly.
