# Candied Sweet Potato

Ever wondered how to transform a humble sweet potato into a caramelized delight that's sweet as candy? Here's a foolproof method that'll make your taste buds dance.

## Ingredients
- 1 sweet potato, long and uniform (think miniature submarine shape)

## Instructions
1. Give your sweet potato a snazzy hasselback haircut: Create 8-10 parallel cuts from opposite sides, slicing only about one-third of the way down. Keep that core intact – we want a fancy accordion, not sweet potato dominoes!

2. Wrap in aluminum foil: This step is non-negotiable – skip it, and you'll end up with a potato that's charred on the outside while still too raw in the middle.

3. Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).

4. Nestle your wrapped spud in the air fryer basket and let it heckle for 40 minutes. Give it a flip and let it tease for another 40 minutes. (Time may vary – smaller potatoes finish their roasts earlier, while the big ones will offer an encore.)

## Why the Air Fryer?
The air fryer is like a desert wind, whisking away moisture and creating the perfect environment for natural sugars to transform into caramel-like glory. In a regular oven, bless its heart, excess moisture can leave you with a fully cooked but less enchanted spud.
