# Introduction

In the west, tapioca is often an ingredient in sweet desserts.
That's why I was so amazed to find that tapioca can be made into a delightful savory dish too.
In my opinion, this oil-free version tastes better than any version that has to rely on oil.

## Recipe

1/2 c dry sabudana makes 2 small servings

Prep 100-140g potato (sliced thin to speed cooking), boil 6min then air fry for 8 min. Set aside.

Soak 1/2 c dry sabudana at room temp for 90 min (chewy) to up 3-4 hours or overnight (soft).

Combine sabudana with:

- 1/4 c peanut (coarse ground in food processor)
- 5 chopped dates (35g) / 15g date sugar (= 2 table)
- 1/2 tea ground cumin seed
- 1/2 tea black salt (or lite salt)
- 1 thai chili or 1/4 jalapeno, minced (optional)
- 4-5g fresh ginger, minced (= 3/4 tea puree)
- 8-10 curry leaves (optional)
- 1 table shredded coconut (optional, don't use coconut flour)
- 1/2 table lemon juice

Mix all ingredients except potato & cilantro. Microwave in a sealed container; 3:30 min works for 1/2 cup, 5 min works for 1 cup, and 9 min for 2 cups. Basically you want the water hot enough to steam for a solid minute.

Combine cooked sabudana with potato & cilantro and serve.
