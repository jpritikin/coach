# Mozzarella

I've tried to make this recipe work with soybeans or tofu, but it throws off the delicate flavor.
The 1:2 ratio of agar agar to tapioca powder creates the perfect consistency. It's gooey when hot, but solidifies when cool.

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup cashew (=32g)
- 1 c water
- 1/2 table lemon juice or 1/8 tea citric acid
- 1 table agar agar powder
- 2 table tapioca powder
- 1 table nutritional yeast
- 1 tea date sugar
- 3/4 tea salt
- 1/2 tea garlic powder

## Instructions

Grind cashews in a high speed blender. Gradually mix liquid with dry ingredients to avoid clumping. Heat to simmer and continue gentle heat for 5 minutes to ensure that the agar agar melts. If the texture remains grainy then you didn't cook it enough.

You can probably cook it covered in a microwave too.
