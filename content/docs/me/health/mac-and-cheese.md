# Introduction

There are lots of vegan mac & cheese recipes out there on the net.
This one tastes **exactly** like the classic Kraft mac & cheese.

## Recipe

Double recipe (makes about 4 cups dry powder):

- 2 cup Cashews
- 1 cup Nutritional Yeast
- 1/2 C. Oat Flour == 2/3 c rolled oats
- 1/2 C. Tapioca Flour
- 2 table Paprika
- 2 table + 1 tea Date Sugar
- 2 table + 1 tea salt
- 2 table Onion Powder
- 2 tsp. Powdered Mustard

Single recipe (makes about 2 cups dry powder):

- 1 C. Cashews
- 1/2 cup Nutritional Yeast
- ¼ C. Oat Flour == 1/3 c rolled oats
- ¼ C. Tapioca Flour
- 1 table Paprika
- 1 table + 1/2 tea Date Sugar
- 1 table + 1/2 tea Salt
- 1 table Onion Powder
- 1 tsp. Powdered Mustard

## Instructions

Add all of the ingredients to a blender (or food processor) and process until a powder is formed.
There should not be any discernible chunks or large granules of cashews, so for a food processor, this may take 3 to 4 minutes of processing.

## How to use this mix

Cook 1 cup of dry macaroni (130g) and drain.

Combine 1/3 cup mix with 2/3 c water.
Whisk well. Either
- Bring to a boil and simmer for a minute
- Cook in microwave

Toss with hot cooked macaroni.

Variation: Instead of pasta, cheese-up your favorite vegetables.

### Quesadilla Variation

Mix 1-2 tablespoons of powder in a small bowl, gradually adding water until it reaches a toothpaste-like consistency. Spread this uncooked mixture onto tortillas. As you heat the tortillas in a pan, the filling will cook naturally. And there you have it--delicious quesadillas!
