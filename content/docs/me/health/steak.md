# Introduction

The texture of seitan is almost always too grainy compared to real beef.
The innovation here is pairing gluten with tapioca flour.
A little tapioca flour greatly improves the texture and give the gluten a homogeneous mouth feel.

## Dry ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups vital wheat gluten
- 1/4 cup tapioca flour
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Mix well before adding liquid.

### Texture

If you feel like this recipe is too homogeneous (e.g., like chicken breast meat) then you can try with one or more of the following additives to provide more textural variation.

- 1 table tapioca pearls (soak 2-3 hours)
- 1 table green lentils (cook al dente, boil 9-12 min)
- 1 table crushed walnut

## Wet ingredients

- 1/2 cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke

## Process

Gradually combine dry and wet ingredients together. If necessary, add a little bit more water.

Stretch by hand into steak shapes. Steam (don't pressure cook) for 10 min (takes 2-3 cups of water).

As a finishing touch, coat with BBQ sauce. Air fry 375F for 3-5 min.
