# Mung-nificent Egg Batter

This recipe is perfect for scrambled eggs or vegan omelets that are so convincing, even your most egg-ceptical friends will be fooled!

For that traditional sunny-side-up yellow color, use polished mung beans–they're the golden children of the legume family. But if you're feeling adventurous, unpolished mung beans will give you a green-tinted batter that would make Dr. Seuss proud. Sam-I-Am would definitely approve of these green eggs (no ham required)!

Pro tip: You can keep this uncooked egg batter covered in the fridge for up to 7 days. That's a whole week of egg-cellent breakfast possibilities! Talk about having all your eggs in one basket... err, bowl.

## Recipe

Combine all ingredients in a blender (doesn't need to be high-speed–we're not training for the Blender Olympics here):

- 1 cup split yellow mung beans/moong dal/yellow lentils, soaked overnight
- 1 cup unsweetened soy milk (or 2 table cashew + 1 cup water)
- 3 table nutritional yeast
- 1 ½ tsp salt
- 1 ¼ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp tapioca starch (optional)
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tea black pepper

This batter has more grip than a gecko wearing climbing shoes–it eagerly sticks to pans unless you use enough oil to create your own personal oil slick. But fear not! Avoid the mess by pouring the batter into a covered glass container and letting the microwave work its magic.

Sprinkle with paprika and black pepper to taste.
