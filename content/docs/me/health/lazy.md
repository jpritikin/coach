# Lazy Gyoza Casserole

You want dumplings but your hand-folding skills are on vacation.

**Makes 8 servings**

## The Filling

Shred and mix together:

- 600g purple cabbage (because regular cabbage is boring)
- 160g shiitake mushrooms (or any variety)
- 160g bamboo shoots
- 120g carrot
- 40g green onion
- 40g garlic
- 20g ginger
- 3/2 cup TVP (textured vegetable protein)
- 1/4 cup tapioca starch (or whatever starch is haunting your pantry)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons molasses (for that sweet umami)
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon white pepper (no substitute)
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## The Wrapper Situation

- 1 package egg roll wrappers (the closest you'll get to folding today)

## The "Assembly" (Generous Term)

1. Grab a 2-cup glass container per serving
2. Place 1 wrapper on the bottom (it's like making a dumpling bed)
3. Fill halfway with your purple mountain of filling
4. Slap another wrapper on top like a dumpling blanket
5. Fill the rest of the way to the top
6. Cover and microwave for 3 minutes

**That's it.**

*Serve with the quiet satisfaction of having outsmarted tradition.*
