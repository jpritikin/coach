What if everything we thought we knew about religion was backward? We often assume that religions are built on beliefs--beliefs about gods, afterlife, and the nature of reality. But what if belief actually blocks us from genuine religious experience? This book pursues a radical idea: the less we believe, the closer we get to religion.

This may seem counterintuitive. After all, religions are usually defined by their belief systems. Christianity has its creeds, Buddhism its doctrines, Islam its articles of faith. Yet a careful look at religion reveals something surprising. Direct religious experience often involves setting beliefs aside rather than adopting new ones. Mystics across traditions speak of emptying the mind, surrendering certainty, and embracing mystery.

The goal of this book is to explore religion unburdened by belief. We'll examine how beliefs--even seemingly religious ones--can create barriers between us and direct inner experience. Rather than adding new beliefs to your existing collection, we'll work on identifying and releasing limiting beliefs.

Our journey starts at the beginning of the beginning: the oldest religious practices might date back about 33,000 years. This early religious expression took the form of cave art that seems shamanic in nature. We'll explore how modern techniques like careful psychological work, meditation, and psychedelics can help us make a similar journey today.

Along the way, we'll tackle some challenging questions: How do we distinguish genuine religious experience from self-deception? What's the relationship between religious experience and mental health? How can we honor ancient practices while adapting them for modern needs? The answers may surprise you.

This book draws on diverse fields, including anthropology, neuroscience, psychology, and religious studies. But our main guide will be your own direct experience. We will showcase practical ways to explore these ideas yourself, with an eye on safety and ethics.

This journey requires courage. Examining your beliefs--especially cherished religious ones--can be uncomfortable. You may discover that ideas that you thought were helping your inner growth have actually been holding you back. If you're ready to look beyond belief, turn the page and begin.
