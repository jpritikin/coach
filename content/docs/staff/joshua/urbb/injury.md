# Mental Injury

A defensive response to stress is to split off parts of ourselves. This psychological splitting happens when experiences become too painful to integrate. A child whose anger triggers punishment learns to exile that angry part. A teen whose grief is met with "be strong" messages learns to lock away sadness. Over time, these exiled aspects don't disappear—they become separate, isolated fragments within us.

When we exile parts of ourselves, we create an inner system of division. The mind's natural wholeness fractures. A bright student who's bullied for showing intelligence might exile her academic passion. She creates a protective part that downplays her abilities to avoid social rejection. Meanwhile, the exiled whiz kid continues to exist, disconnected from the whole. This inner fragmentation requires enormous psychological energy to maintain.

Our culture can reinforce this splitting process. We're told to "put on a happy face" regardless of inner pain. Children learn early that certain emotions are unacceptable—boys shouldn't cry, and girls shouldn't show anger. These messages teach us to exile normal human experiences. The parts we split off don't vanish; they go underground, influencing us in ways we don't recognize or understand.

Family systems often demand this exiling process. A family that can't tolerate sadness forces children to suppress grief. The child exiles their sad part to maintain family harmony. But that exiled part still needs expression. It might emerge through physical symptoms, nightmares, or unexpected emotional outbursts. The more parts we exile, the more fragmented and dysfunctional our inner system becomes.

The real problem isn't the exiled parts themselves—it's the separation and lack of communication between parts. When exiled parts can't communicate with us, they may resort to extreme measures to make themselves heard. A child who exiled vulnerability might develop perfectionism. The perfectionist part works hard to prevent failure. It may not realize that protection of the vulnerable exiled part is fueling its drive.

Recovery begins when we reverse this splitting process. By turning toward exiled parts and rebuilding inner communication, we move toward wholeness. Healing isn't about eliminating any part. It's about restoring the natural internal connections that psychological splitting disrupted. As we learn to welcome all parts of ourselves, we find we don't need the behaviors that were protecting our exiled parts anymore.
