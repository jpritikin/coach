{{% details "Too inexpensive? 💰" %}}
I have no educational debt. I own a home. My daughter's college education is mostly paid for.

## Notes

[^capture-of-nutrition]: Is it probably a good thing that I am not a licensed dietician given [The corporate capture of the nutrition profession in the USA: the case of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-in-the-usa-the-case-of-the-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics/9FCF66087DFD5661DF1AF2AD54DA0DF9).
