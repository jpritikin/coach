## Books

{{% columns %}}

In his groundbreaking new book, Joshua Pritikin explores the provocative idea that belief systems obstruct authentic religious experience. Building on James Carse's foundational work, "The Way" takes this premise to its logical conclusion, offering a methodical investigation into what religion might look like when freed from the constraints of belief.

This transformative book reveals the crucial distinction between religion and belief systems. While rigid beliefs often lead to division, true religion thrives on mystery and openness to the unknown. Drawing from historical examples and world traditions, it shows how embracing "higher ignorance"‚Äîknowing the limits of what we can know‚Äîcreates space for genuine spiritual exploration. For anyone seeking wisdom beyond dogma in our polarized world, this book offers a refreshing path forward.
