I am currently a trainee under Joshua's supervision. I work with adult individuals.

I provide *counseling* under [ORS 675.825(4)(a)](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_675.825), which allows alternative counselors to practice legally in Oregon without a 🪪 license. Since I am **not** licensed in Oregon, I cannot describe myself 🤐 as a *psychotherapist*. [ORS 675.020](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_675.020)
