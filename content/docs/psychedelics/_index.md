## My experience

Psychedelics are substances that reveal and amplify your inner experience.

I have personal experience with:

*   Psilocybin
*   Salvia divinorum
*   Cannabis
*   Daime (a.k.a. ayahuasca)

I attend a [local psychedelic church](https://www.chlq.org/).

I am also a member of the [Sacred Garden Church](https://sacredgarden.life/).
