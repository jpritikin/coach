# Counseling

I work with individual adults. By the end of 2023,
I will also offer counseling to couples and small groups.

## What does counseling look like?

As a default, I recommend 75-minute sessions on a weekly basis. However,
other schedules can be accommodated.
The duration of therapy can vary depending on your needs and motivation.
During the no-fee consultation, we’ll decide together what is the best fit.

## Location

I live in White City, Oregon (near the California border).

I am seeing clients by video or audio-only[^audio-only] (your choice).

As I am not licensed,[^license] I can work with anyone, anywhere in the world.

## Fees

My rate is $20 per hour for the first two hours. Thereafter, my rate is $120 per hour. Reserve time in 15 min increments. I do not accept insurance.

People with low income, or veterans or active military may request a sliding scale rate.

Book a free 20 min consultation.

## Notes

[^audio-only]: In the classical approach to psychotherapy, the client lies on a couch and does not look the therapist directly in the eye while speaking.

[^license]: I do maintain an Association for Coaching membership. [A complaint process is available.]({{< relref "complaints" >}})
