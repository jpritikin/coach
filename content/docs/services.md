# Counseling

I work with individuals and dyads (e.g. couples or two people in a relationship). By the end of 2023,
I will also offer counseling to small groups. 🫱🏿‍🫲🏻

## What does counseling look like?

As a default, I recommend 75-minute sessions on a weekly basis. However,
other schedules can be accommodated.
The duration of therapy can vary depending on your needs and motivation.
During the no-fee consultation, we’ll decide together what is the best fit.

## Location

I am seeing clients by video or audio-only.

For individual therapy, you may prefer audio-only ☎.[^audio-only]
When working with dyads, video is required.[^one-way-video]

I am located in Oregon (near California).[^native]
As I am not licensed,[^license] I can work with anyone, anywhere in the world (time-zone permitting). 🌎

## Fees

My rate is $20 per hour for the first two hours. Thereafter, my rate is $100 per hour. Reserve time in 15 min increments. I do not accept insurance. 💰

People with low income, or veterans or active military may request a sliding scale rate.

Book a free 20 min consultation.

## Notes

[^audio-only]: In the classical approach to psychotherapy, the client lies on a couch 🛋️ and does not look the therapist directly in the eye while speaking.

[^license]: I maintain an Association for Coaching membership. [A complaint process is available.]({{< relref "complaints" >}})

[^native]: I want to acknowledge that I live on the traditional
territory of the Shasta; Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians;
Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde; Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla;
Cow Creek Umpqua; Takelma; and Modoc. See https://native-land.ca/

[^one-way-video]: If you find my face distracting then I can turn off
my video, but I need eyes on your video feeds to watch for nonverbal cues.
