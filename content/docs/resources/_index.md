# Resources

As an IFS Practitioner, I try to be strict with myself about attending
to structure and process while maintaining indifference to content.  I
believe that a good counselor is extremely neutral, to encourage the
client's inner system to lead.  In real life, however, I am highly
opinionated about diverse content areas. This is the safe space for me
to broadcast my opinions.
