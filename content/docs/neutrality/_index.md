As an IFS Practitioner, I attend
to structure and process while maintaining indifference to content.
I believe that a good counselor is extremely neutral, to encourage the
client's inner system to lead.

In real life, however, I am highly opinionated about diverse content
areas.
This area is the safe space for me to broadcast my opinions.
