# Sahasrara

Sahasrara is the point of connection between the universal Self and
our personal Self.
The founder of [Sahaja Yoga Meditation](https://us.sahajayoga.org/)
claimed that she, "opened the sahasrara." Hence, one would expect some
technique for accessing the sahasrara. Here is a mash-up of two
techniques from Sahaja Yoga.

## Details

Circular motion between right hand and top of head

Randomly vary speed between slow, fast, and medium.
