# Cold exposure

Do [foat soaking]({{< relref "foot-soak" >}}) but with ice cold water.

Don't combine this with [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses" >}})
because you should use all of your attention to relax your
feet. Use ample ice because it's easier to relax when the water is at
lower temperature.[^carney2020]

Very effective for [Restless Legs Syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/restless-legs-syndrome-fact-sheet).

One virtue of this method of cold exposure is that it doesn't depend
on the weather and requires little ice (1 quart is pictured).

You can combine this technique with [liver treatment]({{< relref "liver" >}}).
