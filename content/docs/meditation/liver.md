# Ice on the liver

Don't overdo it. Keep an undershirt between the cold pack and your
body. This technique is not like [cold exposure]({{< relref
"cold-exposure" >}}); you don't need to exercise much control over
your attention.

Or you can use regular ice.

If you have normal anatomy, the liver is on the right side.

## Timing

Do not attempt this treatment on an empty stomach. Immediately
before sleeping works well.
