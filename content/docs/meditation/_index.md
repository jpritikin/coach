- Christian
- Islam
- Hinduism
- Buddhism (Vajrayāna, Mahāyāna, & Zen)
- Daoism (Taoism)
- Judaism
- etc

Goal:

- Personal transformation

The techniques I describe here assume that you are already proficient

On breathing technique:
  Exhale longer duration than inhale helps calm yourself.
  There are other techniques (Holotropic Breathwork, Wim Hof Method) with which I have little experience.
