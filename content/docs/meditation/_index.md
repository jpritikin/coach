# Meditation

## What is meditation?

To try to answer this question, I have studied the contemplative
traditions of many of the world's major religions:

- Christianity
- Islam
- Hinduism

<--->

- Buddhism (Vajrayāna, Mahāyāna, & Zen)
- Daoism (Taoism)
- Judaism

I have also studied with a handful of contemporary meditation
teachers. What I learned is that there is not much consensus about the
precise defintion of *meditation*. I prefer to define meditation in
IFS terms:

{{< hint info >}}
Meditation becomes possible when you are not identified with your
parts. Meditation occurs when some proportion of your being is
free to radiate Self energy.
{{< /hint >}}

In some traditions, there is a notion of *enlightenment* or
*liberation* that demarcates some stage of personal transformation.
However, we should not be satisfied with personal transformation of any degree;
the appropriate benchmark for attainment is global, societal transformation.
Everybody should have the opportunity to climb Maslow's pyramid.

## Meditation Techniques

Meditation is more like a dance than a desk lamp. There are moves to learn.
The techniques that I describe in sub-sections assume that you are already
proficient in meditation. Without a basic competence in IFS meditation,
you may not obtain any benefit from these techniques. Moreover, these
techniques may not work when under the influence of psychedelics.

### On breathing

To calm yourself, exhale for a longer duration than your inhalation.[^adhana2013]

{{< hint info >}}
When a dog is lying down and wants to relax then she will often start her rest with two quick breaths followed by a long, slow exhale.

There are other interesting techniques (Holotropic Breathwork, Wim Hof Method[^carney2017])
with which I have little experience.

### On mantras, prayers, poetry, music

In a solo context, there is potential for spiritual bypass. A
mantra recited vigorously can pave over and hide unaddressed parts with
unaddressed issues that would otherwise be in dialog filling your head
with thoughts. Suppression is not a good long-term strategy.

In a group context, prayers and music can help synchronize individuals
and invite communitas.[^turner2012]

### Timing

The best time to practice meditation is 4:30 to 9:00 (am and pm) in your local time zone.

### Sample Schedule

| When | Activity | Duration |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| morning | drink green tea | - |
|      | [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses"  >}}) | 10 min |
|      | [sahasrara]({{< relref "sahasrara"  >}}) | 5-10 min |
| before dinner | [foot soak]({{< relref "foot-soak"  >}}) \& [withdrawal of the senses]({{< relref "senses"  >}}) | 15 min |
|      | [sahasrara]({{< relref "sahasrara"  >}}) | 10 min |
| before sleep | [ice on the liver]({{< relref "liver"  >}}) | 15 min |

This is just a sample schedule. Customize as per your preference.
