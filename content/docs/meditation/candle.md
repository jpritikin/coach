# Candle treatment

This technique was pioneered at the Sahaja Yoga Vashi Hospital in
Mumbai India. It is a bit too elaborate to easily describe on a web
page. A simplified version follows.

Sit cross-legged on the floor. Lift a candle holder with your right
hand. Slowly maneuver the candle up and down the left side (emotional
side) of your body from the lower abdomen to the shoulder.

The technique actually requires at least three candles:

- Use the first candle as described above.
- Second candle is placed in-line with your body on the left side at
  the height of your lower abdomen.
- Third candle is placed behind your back on the left side at
  the height of your lower abdomen.

## Variations

There are more elaborate setups that combine this technique with [foot
soaking]({{< relref "foot-soak" >}}).

Instead of maneuvering the candle in front of your body, an assistant
can maneuver the candle behind your back up and down on the left side.
