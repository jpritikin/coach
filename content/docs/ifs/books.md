# Annotated Bibliography

You don't need to read any books to receive counseling.

I put this page here to document my own journey learning the IFS model.
These are the books that I feel are practice focused, actually teach you how to facilitate IFS sessions.

- Sweezy, M. (2023). *Internal Family Systems Therapy for Shame and Guilt.* The Guilford Press.
    {{< hint info >}}
    There is coverage of shame and guilt, but that is a tiny portion of the scope of this book. Lots of wisdom here. For example, an ingenious framework for unblending (pp. 134-135).

## Why no books on Intimacy from the Inside Out (IFIO)?

IFIO is amazing, but in my opinion, has not been well systematized.
The best way to learn IFIO is to take trainings and receive consultation from experienced trainers.
The books are not useless, but are woefully incomplete.
