Poor outcomes can result if cause-and-effect relationships are misunderstood.  
It is important to ask **why** things happen.[^judea2018][^sapolsky2023]  
For example, there is the concept of *self-esteem*, confidence in one's worth.  
Philosophers say, "Everybody is valuable";  
It would be nice if self-esteem could be increased directly.  
However, self-esteem is more of an effect than a cause.[^storr2017]  
Increase self-esteem by striving for achievement and compassion.[^kwan2009]  
The causal structure of gratitude is similar;  
Gratitude is more of an effect than a cause.  
A little gratitude can help jump-start Self energy.  
Yet, gratitude must be felt in proportion to what is received.  
Anything else is artifice, self-deception.  
Those who benefit from a formal gratitude practice[^gratitude-meditation] haven't received much.  
It is a privilege to be an [IFS Practitioner]({{< relref "ifs" >}}).  
We have received a great gift.  
As psychological healers, we exceed past luminaries by far.[^schwartz2017]  
The gratitude I feel can be overwhelming and incapacitating.  
Too much gratitude gets in the way of the work!  
It is like walking along the narrow ridge of a mountain  
Facing stiff wind and treacherous footing.  
Make space for clearheaded judgment;  
Perhaps the Parts that feel gratitude can step back and stay in the waiting room.  
Only surefooted and true can we salve the knots of tangled minds.  
The need for healing is great.  
Celebrate later!
