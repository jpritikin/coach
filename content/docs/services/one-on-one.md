# Counseling

I work with individuals and dyads (e.g. couples or two people in a relationship). 🫱🏿‍🫲🏻

## What does counseling look like?

As a default, I recommend 75-minute sessions every week.
{{% details "No 🤨" %}}
Other schedules can be accommodated. 🙏🏼
The duration of therapy can vary depending on your needs and motivation.
During the no-fee consultation, we’ll decide together what is the best fit. 😃

### Couples & Dyads

I plead that you regard 90-minute sessions as a **minimum** duration.
{{% details "Why? 😠" %}}
There is a lot of per-session overhead.
At the beginning of every session, we need to negotiate what to work on.
At the end of every session, I will solicit your feedback so we can plan the next session.
The intro and outro sections together can take 30 minutes or more. ⏳
Add to that that couples counseling is extremely delicate. 🦋🐝
To work safely, we have to progress slowly, with great caution.

## Location

I am seeing clients by video 📹 or audio-only 🎙️.

For individual therapy, you may prefer audio-only ☎.[^audio-only]
When working with dyads, video is required.[^one-way-video]

I am located in Oregon (near California).[^native]
As I am not licensed, I can work with anyone, anywhere in the world (time-zone permitting). 🌎

## How long does it take? When will I see results?

{{% details "Individuals" %}}
It depends on your individual situation and goals. Some clients get complete relief in three hours or less. Other clients may need tens of hours of work to begin to approach goals.
{{% /details %}}
{{% details "Couples & Dyads" %}}
Quick results are unlikely. Don't expect much progress until we reach at least 10 hours. Couples counseling typically takes more time compared to work with individuals.

## Notes

[^audio-only]: In the classical approach to psychotherapy, the client lies on a couch 🛋️ and does not look the therapist directly in the eye 👀 while speaking.

[^native]: I acknowledge that I live on the traditional
territory of the Shasta; Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians;
Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde; Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla;
Cow Creek Umpqua; Takelma; and Modoc. See https://native-land.ca/

[^one-way-video]: If you find my face distracting then I can turn off
my video, but I need eyes on your video feeds to watch for nonverbal cues.
