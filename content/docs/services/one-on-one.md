# Counseling

I work with individuals and dyads (e.g. couples or two people in a relationship). 🫱🏿‍🫲🏻

## What does counseling look like?

As a default, I recommend 75-minute sessions every week. However,
other schedules can be accommodated.
The duration of therapy can vary depending on your needs and motivation.
During the no-fee consultation, we’ll decide together what is the best fit.

### Couples & Dyads

I plead that you regard 75-minute sessions as a **minimum** duration.
Couples counseling is extremely delicate.
To work safely, we have to progress slowly, with great caution.
This takes time.

I'm a butterfly on the wall. At each opportunity, I flutter my wings,
and a little beautiful dust is sprinkled on each partner. Gradually
mutual understanding grows.

## Notes

[^audio-only]: In the classical approach to psychotherapy, the client lies on a couch 🛋️ and does not look the therapist directly in the eye 👀 while speaking.

[^native]: I acknowledge that I live on the traditional
territory of the Shasta; Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians;
Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde; Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla;
Cow Creek Umpqua; Takelma; and Modoc. See https://native-land.ca/

[^one-way-video]: If you find my face distracting then I can turn off
my video, but I need eyes on your video feeds to watch for nonverbal cues.
