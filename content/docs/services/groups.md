# Groups

I facilitate online Healing Circles of 4-6 people.
Groups meet for 90 min sessions every week.[^in-person]
To convene a group, there has to be a coincidence of wants:
a mutually acceptable meeting time slot and theme.
If one of the themes listed below appeals to you,
<a href="https://forms.gle/EM3pmjCRnnZpYYUN7" target="_blank">fill out and submit this form</a>.
We will be in touch.

## Themes

### Men's Group

Due to my own limited background and expertise, this group is for men with the following profile:

- biologically male at birth
- cisgender
- heterosexual

No disrespect, but please look elsewhere if you are gay, bisexual, or transgender.

**Brotherhood of Understanding**: Forge genuine connections, share insights, and build a strong network of support among men who are walking similar paths.

**Explore Masculinity**: Dive into discussions about masculinity, societal expectations, relationships, emotional well-being, and personal growth. Challenge stereotypes, embrace authenticity, and redefine what it means to be a man in today's evolving world.

**Cultivate Inner Resilience**: Whether you're facing transitions, personal hurdles, or seeking self-improvement, our group offers a space for growth and healing.

### Psychedelic Integration Group (*open to any gender*)

Harness the power of IFS to navigate the intricate landscapes of your mind unveiled by psychedelics. This innovative psychotherapeutic method recognizes that within each of us exists a diverse internal family of subpersonalities, each with its own voice, needs, and wounds. By engaging with these facets of your psyche, IFS guides you in developing a compassionate and healing relationship with yourself.

When paired with the insights and expanded consciousness facilitated by psychedelics, IFS offers a synergistic approach that enables you to:

1. **Deepen Self-Awareness:** Navigate the depths of your psyche, uncovering the roots of past traumas, fears, and patterns that may have held you back. Psychedelic experiences can provide initial insights, while IFS facilitates ongoing exploration and integration.

2. **Harmonize Inner Conflicts:** Just as psychedelics can offer a fresh perspective, IFS empowers you to mediate conflicts and tensions within your internal family. By acknowledging and nurturing these parts, you foster inner harmony and create a foundation for personal growth.

3. **Cultivate Self-Compassion:** Psychedelic journeys can be intense and emotionally charged. IFS equips you with tools to embrace and comfort these heightened emotions, fostering a sense of self-compassion that carries forward into your daily life.

4. **Navigate Ego Dissolution:** IFS provides a structured approach to navigate the dissolution of ego boundaries often experienced during psychedelic trips. By understanding these states and engaging with them in a safe and guided manner, you can glean invaluable insights for personal evolution.

5. **Integration for Lasting Change:** The integration of psychedelic experiences is essential for meaningful transformation. IFS offers a structured and gradual process to incorporate insights gained during your journeys, translating them into tangible shifts in your daily life.

Discover the unparalleled synergy between IFS and the profound insights of psychedelic experiences. Unleash the potential for holistic healing, self-discovery, and personal growth, as you embark on a journey towards a more harmonious and empowered self.
