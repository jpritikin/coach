# Groups / Healing Circles

## Groups offer benefits beyond what is possible with individual counseling

1. IFS groups offer the feeling of community, which can foster insight and potentially reparative interpersonal interactions with group members.
2. IFS groups offer the collective, felt experience of Self-energy.
3. IFS groups offer observable correlations and real-time experiences between the identification of Parts and the individual's behavior.
4. IFS groups offer an opportunity for individuals to see their Parts as universally natural and part of being human.
5. IFS groups help foster natural accountability by supporting the inherent motivation of the individual's internal system toward health, wholeness, harmony, and purpose.

## Current Status

There is not enough interest yet to offer healing circles.
Joshua hopes to offer group experiences in the future.
