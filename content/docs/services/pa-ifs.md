# Psychedelic-Assisted Counseling

Many of my clients do not use psychedelics
in conjunction with counseling. This is completely optional.

## Psilomethoxin

Psilomethoxin (Pm) offers soothing comfort similar to MDMA, but without MDMAâ€™s stimulant-like effects.
Pm has a one hour onset, two hour plateau, and one to three hour come down.
At the recommended low dose, Pm is not hallucinogenic. You remain fully able
to navigate the world and engage in ordinary conversation. The effect is mainly
at the emotional level.

### How to Obtain Psilomethoxin

Consult the [contraindications]({{< relref "psilomethoxin" >}})
and decide whether you wish
to proceed. If you decide to proceed, become a member of
the [Church of Psilomethoxin](https://psilomethoxin.com/?sld=jpritikin) and order sacrament.
Sacrament is delivered directly to you; I am not involved.

## What does psychedelic-assisted counseling look like?

Psychedelic-assisted counseling looks very similar to [sober]({{< relref "basic" >}}) counseling. The only difference is that you will be in a slightly altered state of mind during our session.
Strictly speaking, this is known as [psycholytic therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy#Psycholytic_therapy).
Book at least one session without psychedelics
so we can get to know each other and begin to develop a therapeutic alliance.

1. Reserve a 90-120 minute session on [my calendar](https://joshua-pritikin.clientsecure.me/sign-in).

2. Ingest two scoops (300mg of dried mushroom powder) one hour before
our session. We may need to fine tune the dose, but the goal is to
give you more access to smoothing comfort without interfering
with normal conversation.

3. [Talk therapy]({{< relref "ifs" >}}) will commence as usual.

### Cost

The Church of Psilomethoxin charges about $10-15 per gram of dried mushroom powder.
Therefore, you can expect to spend, at most, an extra $6 per session for
psychedelic-assisted counseling in comparison with sober counseling.
My hourly rate is the same in either case.

### Legal considerations

As of 24 Feb 2023, psilomethoxin is unregulated in the United States
but may be considered illegal under the Federal Analogue Act.
This is a gray area!
The Church of Psilomethoxin distributes sacrament using regular
mail services (e.g., FedEx).
Any legal dispute would likely be directed at church leaders
rather than church members.[^cop-leaders]

## Q & A

{{% details "Do you work with other doses of psilomethoxin besides 300mg of dried mushroom powder?" %}}
Lower doses are possible. With higher doses, a client's attention may be
too firmly drawn innerward, impeding normal conversation. If there is
an interest in exploring higher doses, it would be sensible to do
this separately from talk therapy.
For example, if a client wanted to take 1g or 2g of psilomethoxin (a medium to heavy dose)
then this could be done four or more hours before a talk therapy session.
Doing talk therapy immediately after a high dose is what many contemporary
research studies are doing.
This might be appropriate in a carefully controlled context and facilitate
rapid symptom relief.
However, I believe that psycholytic therapy is safer than this approach because
there is no need for the client to navigate an intense psychedelic experience.

{{% details "Is there any scientific evidence that psilomethoxin-assisted IFS works better than the sober version?" %}}
No, since psilomethoxin has not been studied yet.
This offering is inspired by and extrapolated from MAPS studies with MDMA.[^maps-ifs-mdma]
{{% /details %}}

{{% details "Why psilomethoxin? Do you work with any other substances?" %}}
MAPS has put enormous resources into making MDMA an FDA approved medicine
for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.[^mdma-history]
I suspect psilomethoxin may be even better than MDMA
for this application.
I am not aware of any potentially superior substance.

{{% details "How does your service compare to Oregon Psilocybin Services (OSP)?" %}}
- Psilocybin can only be used at a state licensed facility. Psilocybin cannot be ingested at home in a telehealth context.
- Compared to MDMA or psilomethoxin, psilocybin is not an ideal, entry-level substance for the psychedelically naive.
- OSP requires the continued presence of a sober facilitator during the administration
session. Even if the facilitator is a licensed psychologist,
the facilitator can only act in the capacity of a facilitator
and cannot engage in talk therapy during the administration session.

{{% details "How does your service compare to ketamine telehealth?" %}}
- Ketamine telehealth became legal the United States in part because of
the federal COVID-19 public health emergency.
After the emergency ends in May 2023, the legal status of 
ketamine telehealth will depend on state law.[^hb-2023feb02]
- With ketamine, talk therapy happens after, not during, an administration
session. Talk therapy may not be given much emphasis.
Some low cost providers omit talk therapy.
- Compared to MDMA or psilomethoxin, ketamine is not an ideal, entry-level substance.
