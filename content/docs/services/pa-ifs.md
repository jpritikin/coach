# Psychedelic-Assisted Counseling

Many of my clients do not use psychedelics
in conjunction with counseling. This is completely optional.

## What does psychedelic-assisted counseling look like?

1. Book at least one session without psychedelics
so we can get to know each other and begin to develop a therapeutic alliance.

2. Consult the [contraindications]({{< relref "psilomethoxin" >}})
and decide whether you wish
to proceed. If you decide to proceed, order sacrament
from the [Church of Psilomethoxin](https://psilomethoxin.com/?sld=jpritikin).
Sacrament is delivered directly to you; I am not involved.

3. Psilomethoxin has a one hour onset, two hour plateau, and one to three hour come down.
[Reserve a 90-120 minute session on my calendar.](https://joshua-pritikin.clientsecure.me/sign-in)

4. Ingest two scoops (300mg of dried Psilocybe powder) one hour before
our session. We may need to fine tune the dose, but the goal is to
give you more access to smoothing comfort without interfering
with normal conversation.

5. Talk therapy will commence as usual while you are
in a slightly altered state of consiousness.

6. Repeat from step #3 as often as you require.

### Cost

Church of Psilomethoxin charges about $10-15 per gram of dried Psilocybe powder.
Therefore, you can expect to spend an extra $6 per session for
psychedelic-assisted counseling in comparison with sober counseling.
My hourly rate is the same in either case.

### Legal considerations

As of 24 Feb 2023, psilomethoxin is unregulated in the United States
but may be considered illegal under the Federal Analogue Act.
This is a grey area!
The Church of Psilomethoxin distributes psilomethoxin using regular
mail services (e.g., FedEx).

## Q & A

{{% details "Do you work with other doses of psilomethoxin besides 300mg of dried Psilocybe powder?" %}}
Lower doses are possible. With higher doses, a client's attention may be
too firmly drawn innerward, impeding normal conversation. If there is
an interest in exploring higher doses, it would be more sensible to do
this separately from talk therapy.

{{% details "Is there any scientific evidence that psilomethoxin-assisted IFS works better than the sober version?" %}}
No, since psilomethoxin has not been studied yet.
This offering is inspired by and extrapolated from MAPS studies with MDMA.[^maps-ifs-mdma]

{{% details "Why psilomethoxin? Do you work with any other substances?" %}}
MAPS has put enormous resources into making MDMA an FDA approved medicine
for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.[^mdma-history]
I suspect psilomethoxin may be even better than MDMA.
I am not aware of any potentially superior substances.

{{% details "How does your service compare to Oregon Psilocybin Services (OSP)?" %}}
- Psilocybin cannot be ingested at home. Psilocybin can only be used at a state licensed facility.
- OSP requires the continued presence of a sober facilitator during the administration
session. Even if the facilitator is a licensed psychologist,
the facilitator can only act in the capacity of a facilitator
and cannot engage in talk therapy during the administartion session.

{{% details "How does your service compare to ketamine telehealth?" %}}
- Ketamine telehealth became legal the United States in part because of
the federal COVID-19 public health emergency.
After the emergency ends in May 2023, the legal status of 
ketamine telehealth will depend on state law.[^hb-2023feb02]

- With ketamine, talk therapy happens after, not during, an administration
session. Talk therapy may not be given much emphasis.
Some low cost providers omit talk therapy.
