# Counseling

Hi, I'm Joshua Pritikin.

My goal is to empower you with more access to calm, confidence,
courage, clarity, and connection. I use **Internal Family Systems**
(IFS). IFS is an evidence-based mode of psychotherapy that has been
proven to heal many forms of psychological suffering.

IFS is a full range therapy. Most psychotherapy aims to help people
get from ‘bad’ to ‘so-so,’ or from ‘so-so’ to ‘good’. IFS can also
help people get from ‘good’ to ‘great’.

I am a trauma-informed coach.

## Areas of Experise

- Anxiety & Stress
- Relationship issues
- [Psychedelic integration](../10_integration)
- [Life style, nutrition, & physical health](../40_health)

## Professional Background

I am **not** an Oregon Licensed Professional Counselor, but I earned a
Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology in 2016 from University of
Virginia. I have practiced meditation for more than 30 years. I
completed IFS Level 1 course Nov 2022 and continuously invest in
personal growth and development.
