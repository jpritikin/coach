## Continuing Clients

The best way to communicate is to use the [SimplePractice](https://joshua-pritikin.clientsecure.me/sign-in) portal.
Check your spam folder for `simplepractice.com` if you have trouble logging in.

For more urgent concerns, you can text my mobile. I do not use voicemail on my phone.
